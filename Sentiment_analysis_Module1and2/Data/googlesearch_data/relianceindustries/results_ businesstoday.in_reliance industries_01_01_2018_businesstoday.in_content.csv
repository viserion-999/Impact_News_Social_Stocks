Reliance Industries said it will acquire 66 per cent stake in Den Networks for Rs 2,290 crore and 51.3 per cent in Hathway Cable for Rs 2,940 crore. The move is likely to speed up the roll out of Jio GigaFiber by bringing under its fold 27,000 local cable operators who would help strengthen its fibre-based broadband service to households for offering ultra high definition entertainment on large screen TVs.RIL will make a ""primary investment of Rs 2,045 crore through a preferential issue under SEBI regulations and secondary purchase of Rs 245 crore from the existing promoters for a 66 per cent stake in DEN"", the company said in a statement.

2018-11-04,"British bank HSBC has executed India's first financial transaction using blockchain for a deal involving an export by Reliance Industries to an American client. The blockchain-enabled letter of credit transaction was for a shipment from the Mukesh Ambani-led company to US-based Tricon Energy, and helped reduce the time required to process the documents.""The use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant seven-ten days to less than a day,"" RIL joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari was quoted as saying by PTI.The blockchain platform was integrated with the electronic bill of lading (eBL) platform to issue and manage an electronic bill of lading, it said, adding this allows a digital transfer of the title of goods from the seller to the buyer in the underlying trade.The statement claimed that the solution is a significant improvement for any organisation involved in buying and selling goods internationally, as it brings together all parties onto one platform.Blckchain solutions is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks and is deemed to be very transparent as all the stakeholders can view progress real time.A slew of domestic lenders, including ICICI Bank, SBI and Yes Bank among others are working on blockchain solutions and count trade finance as one of the best use cases for the technology because of the ability to cut down on time.HSBC's head of global banking and markets Hitendra Dave said blockchain has a transformative impact on trade finance transactions and enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster.That apart, it can ensure cost effectiveness, quicker turnaround and also potentially unlock liquidity for businesses, he added.For this transaction between Reliance and Tricon, the LC was issued by ING Bank, Brussels for Tricon Energy US with HSBC India as the advising and negotiating bank for Reliance, it said, claiming the how the transaction validates the commercial and operational viability of blockchain as an alternative to conventional exchanges for paper-based documentation.Explaining the current system, it said at present buyers and sellers use paper-based LCs to underpin transactions and physical documents are sent to each party in the transaction by post, courier or fax.While the current system provides a high level of certainty, the time and cost involved in processing the documents are deterrents for exporters.HSBC said it, along with five other banks globally supporting the 'Corda application', is seeking to expand the network on an open source basis to drive adoption across the industry.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/hsbc-executes-india-first-overseas-blockchain-payment-for-reliance-industries/story/288187.html
2018-07-13,"A day after entering the $100 billion m-cap club, Reliance Industries' stock continued its rally on Friday to breach the 7 lakh crore market valuation. The RIL stock surged past the 1,100 mark to hit an all-time high of 1107.25 level taking the market capitalisation of Mukesh Ambani-owned conglomerate to Rs 7,01,404 crore (over $102 billion) on BSE. RIL has become the second company in the country to achieve this feat after TCS.It is not for the first time that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) has crossed the $100 billion valuation mark. The m-cap of oil-to-telecom conglomerate had last scaled this milestone in October 2007 when the rupee was valued at 39.5 against the dollar. ""In every phase of our growth our mantra has been simple - set up a firm foundation. Then change the rules of the game. Then change the game itself,"" Ambani had told India Today in 2007. With the launch of Reliance Jio, one can safely say that the prophetic mantra RIL Chairman adhered to has helped the company catapult to Rs 6,88,766 crore valuation.Ambani, who took over the reins of the company his father founded, had also told India Today that RIL is always known for ""making paradigm and disruptive changes"" in the market place. It's costly bet on Jio is a testimony to the disruption that telecom sector in the country has undergone in the last two years.Rise of RelianceThe mammoth aspirations of Reliance date back to a time when Dhirubhai Ambani returned to India from Yemen in 1957 to start a yarn trading business from a small 500 sq.ft. office in Masjid Bunder area of Mumbai. Dhirubhai's first company was called Reliance Commercial Corporation.In 1960s, Dhirubhai and his cousin Champaklal Damani co-founded Reliance Commercial Corporation which ran a polyester business. In 1965, the partnership ended but Dhirubhai continued the business. Vimal, the first brand from Reliance, founded in 1966 at Naroda in Gujarat, became a household name.In 1977, when it was difficult to raise capital, Reliance Textile Industries' IPO created history by introducing the equity cult in India. The issue was oversubscribed seven times. In 1982, Reliance begins backward integration. Elder son Mukesh Ambani leads the establishment of Reliance's first mega manufacturing project at Patalganga in a record 18 months. Younger son Anil joins the business in 1983. In 1985, Reliance Textiles Industries was renamed Reliance Industries Limited as we know today. Reliance's backward integration journey continues. The Hazira plant coming on stream in 1991 laid the foundation for Reliance becoming the world's largest integrated producer of polyester.This was followed by mega polyester plant capacities, the mammoth Rs 25,000 crore, 27 mtpa refinery in Jamnagar. In 2000 Reliance commissioned the world's largest refinery in Jamnagar in a record 36 months. Following Dhirubhai Ambani's death in 2002, Mukesh Ambani became chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd and Anil Ambani was made vice-chairman. The market-capitalisation of the undivided Reliance Industries stood at Rs 28,598.97 crore.In 2002, the site Dhirubhai-6 (D6) block in Krishna-Godavari basin is where Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) made the biggest gas discovery in India and started production of crude oil in May 2008 and natural gas in April 2009.Discovery of basin was announced on Oct. 31, 2002 at the AGM. The market cap on that day was Rs 37,241.39 crore (it rose by Rs 4545.21 crore in a single day). On Oct. 30, 2002, RIL's  m-cap stood at Rs 32,696.18 crore.In 2002, Reliance enters the Infocomm businessIn 2004, Reliance emerges as the first and only private Indian organisation to be listed in the Fortune Global 500 list. Reliance is also the first private sector company to be rated by international credit rating agencies - including Moody's, Standard and Poor's. Also, the feud between the brothers becomes public.In 2005, family reached a settlement to split the Reliance group in a deal brokered by their homemaker mother, Kokilaben.In 2006, Formal split takes place, with Mukesh taking control of flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining and textiles. Ambani launches a retail venture Reliance Retail.The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group gets telecom, power, entertainment and financial services. The Group includes Reliance Communications Ltd , Reliance Infrastructure Ltd , Reliance Capital Ltd , Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and Reliance Power Ltd.In 2009, Reliance commences production of hydrocarbons in its KGD6 block - against all odds - in just over two years of its discovery, making it the world's fastest green-field deepwater oil development project. With this development, Reliance completes an unprecedented backward integration journey.In 2014, Reliance Retail becomes the largest retailer by revenue.  In 2016, Mukesh Ambani announces the launch of Reliance Jio, which upended the mobile data tariffs in the country.In 2017, 170 days after its launch, Reliance Jio crossed 100 million subscribers mark. RIL Chairman launches JioPhone at 40th AGM of RIL. Ambani sets a target of 30 per cent growth each year over the next decade for Reliance Retail, which is expanding in rural and semi-urban markets. That is expected to take Reliance Retail to a revenue of Rs 4.65 lakh crore by 2027, which is not an easy task.In 2018, RIL along with its joint venture partners BP Plc and Niko Resources announced Rs 40,000 crore investment in oil and gas exploration and production. It roped in British giant BP Plc by offering 30 per cent stake in all of its hydrocarbon assets in a $7-billion deal in 2011 to arrest the production slide. However, BP also failed to increase the production, which stands at 5 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) now vis-a-vis its peak of 60 mscmd in 2010. Jio subscriber base grows to 215 million by 41st shareholders' meeting of RIL. Mukesh Ambani announces rollout of broadband network called JioGigaFiber and a new commerce platform.RIL's outstanding debt stood at Rs 2,18,763 crore at the end of last fiscal, while cash and cash equivalent stood at Rs 78,063 crore - largely in bank deposits, mutual funds, corporate deposits, government bonds and other marketable securities.With Reuters inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/how-mukesh-ambani-turned-reliance-into-a-100-billion-dollar-firm/story/280218.html

Ericsson, which inked a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom's nationwide telecom network is trying to recover over Rs 1,000 crore in dues from the Anil Ambani firm. National Company Law Tribunal had admitted three petitions filed by Ericsson against the telco and its subsidiaries and ordered bankruptcy proceedings against Reliance Communications. If the two parties reach a pact, they would have to approach the NCLT to repeal the order.The stock has been on fire on the prospects that if a settlement outside NCLT is allowed, it may help RCom to move ahead with the sale of its telecom tower business to Anil Ambani's elder brother-run Reliance Industries for over Rs 23,000 crore, apart from monetising other assets including selling its sprawling DAKC premises to a Chinese lender.

2018-08-15,"Reliance Industries, which operates the world's largest refining complex, has declared force majeure on gasoline exports from its Jamnagar site, four people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, potentially boosting margins for other suppliers of the oil product. The force majeure follows an unspecified issue at a gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit in its export-oriented refinery with a capacity of more than 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the special economic zone in Jamnagar, two of the people said.Force majeure is typically declared when matters deemed beyond a refinery's control disrupt supplies, allowing it to void some of its contractual obligations to customers.Reliance operates one other refinery in Jamnagar, in Gujarat, which mainly meets domestic demand.The people said at least two gasoline cargoes scheduled for this month's loading from Reliance were affected, one of which was destined for Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. The people declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media.A Reliance Industries spokesman did not answer mobile telephone and email requests for comment.The force majeure on gasoline supplies was declared this week and this could last at least eight days, one of the four people said. It was not immediately clear what the issue at the FCC was, but it is expected to be resolved soon, another source said.""This will have quite an impact on the (Asian) gasoline market,"" said a Singapore-based trader, adding that the market was already reacting to talk of trouble at Reliance's gasoline-making unit even before it had declared force majeure.Reliance had offered a heavy naphtha cargo to the export market last month, which traders took as a sign its gasoline-making unit could be hit by glitches. Heavy naphtha is a feedstock for gasoline or paraxylene and Reliance does not usually offer the grade as it needs the feedstock.Asia's gasoline crack, the premiums or losses of refining a barrel of Brent crude into petrol, hit a fresh 2-1/2 month high of $8.69 a barrel on Aug. 10, before easing to $8.62 a barrel on Tuesday.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-industries-force-majeure-on-gasoline-jamnagar-plant/story/281334.html
2018-11-19,"Reliance Industries (RIL), which pipped Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to become the most-valued company in terms of market capitalisation on Friday, is reportedly now planning to boost its oil-refining capacity by about 50%. This development comes against the backdrop of mushrooming energy demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects India's energy demand to more than double by 2040, making it the single-largest source of global growth. In fact, we are the world's fastest-growing major oil-consuming nation.Citing people in the know, Bloomberg reported that the billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led oil-to-telecom conglomerate has begun discussions with global refinery process licencors and equipment vendors for a new refining train at the Jamnagar complex, the world's biggest refining complex. The proposed plant will be able to process as much as 30 million tons of crude a year, said the sources, adding that given the size envisaged by the company, the project may cost $10 billion.Ambani's moves signal his intent to cement RIL's dominance in the country amid increasing competition. For instance, Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) signed agreements to invest in a proposed 60-million ton refinery complex on India's west coast while Russia's Rosneft PJSC and partners acquired the country's second-largest private oil processor.Meanwhile, Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell are also expanding into fuel retailing in India. Shell has restarted retailing gasoline and diesel in the country, while Total partnered the Adani Group to set up liquefied natural gas import terminals and fuel retailing business.The report added that RIL is looking to process the dirtiest and heaviest crude and may focus on producing feedstock for petrochemicals. According to the sources, the expansion plan is still under discussion and a feasibility report is likely to be prepared by the end of next year, once the recently-expanded petrochemicals capacities stabilise. RIL is expected to make the final investment decision with an aim to start work only in 2020.This is actually the second time in this decade that RIL has considered expanding its refining capacity. In 2013-14 it had sought environment approval for the same, but the company shelved the plan, choosing to focus on increasing downstream chemicals capacities and building its telecom business instead.Things seem more likely to go to plan this time round, given RIL's robust second quarter numbers for this fiscal, driven by its petrochemicals business, and the anticipated domestic demand for fuel. The IEA predicts that India and the Middle East will be bigger oil consumers than the European Union by 2030, driven mainly by diesel for trucks and petrochemicals feedstock.Edited by Sushmita Agarwal",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/mukesh-ambani-reliance-industries-to-expand-jamnagar-complex-to-brace-against-entry-of-saudi-russian-players/story/292390.html

2018-06-25,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to list its telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm in the next two to three years, according to a report. The newest entrant in India's telecom space has become the third-largest in revenue market share in less than two years after it disrupted the market with its free voice and data plans in September 2016. The telco may be listed on Indian bourses after Reliance Industries' consumer businesses overtake its energy business in terms of revenue, according to a report in Mint. Reliance Jio is a 100% subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd. Reliance Jio's entry triggered a price war among telcos when it launched services in September 2016, leading to consolidation in one of the world's most crowded telecom markets.

In December 2017, Bloomberg first reported that Reliance Industries was planning to list its telecom venture.  ""Reliance Industries is holding internal discussions about preparing to list Jio as soon as late 2018 or early 2019,"" the report said. ""Jio may achieve a market capitalization of around Rs 50,000 crore ($7.8 billion) to Rs 70,000 crore through an IPO. That valuation assumes the company will be able to reach annual revenue of about Rs 25,000 crore by the time it lists,"" Arun Kejriwal, founder of advisory firm Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt told Bloomberg in December.Reliance Jio posted a positive net income in its first year of commercial operations, with net profit of Rs 722.96 crore in the financial year 2017-18.

The company's consolidated revenue  stood at Rs 141,699 crore, which rose 9.7 per cent sequentially and 56.5 per cent from the previous quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily on account of higher sales from refining and petrochemical products. Consumer businesses also provided a further boost to the overall revenue. Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased 64.6 per cent to Rs 20,661 crore on the back of 33 per cent volume growth and significant margin improvement in petrochemical business.

However, the company was able to beat the industry estimates.Petrochemicals segment's EBIT -- which represents the approximate amount of operating income generated -- was recorded at Rs 7,857 crore, which was supported by strong Y-o-Y volume growth, improvement across polyester chain margins and stable polymer margins. The oil and gas segment's EBIT (Rs 447 crore Y-o-Y) was impacted by lower volumes due to natural decline. The company's gross refining margin (GRM), which is crucial for oil refiners, for the quarter stood at $10.5/bbl.

At the shareholders' meeting, Mukesh Ambani gave a peek into his long-term plans to grab a bigger piece of country's fast-growing e-commerce sector which is estimated to grow at a 21 per cent CAGR over the next 10 years to $202 billion. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate wants to synergise the widespread presence of Reliance Retail's physical stores with the strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure.According to the report, Alibaba Group's executive chairman, Jack Ma, met RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani in July-end in Mumbai to discuss the proposal. The two reportedly discussed a number of issues, including a plan to create a large omnichannel retail entity through the proposed joint venture.""Alibaba is willing to pick up a significant stake in Reliance Retail, preferably 50 per cent, which will require Alibaba to invest $5-6 billion,"" the report added.The joint venture will be the largest investment by Alibaba in an Indian company.""The deal is crucial for Alibaba, especially after RBI (Reserve Bank of India) directed Paytm (in which Alibaba holds 49%) to stop on-boarding new customers because of the shareholding pattern of Paytm,"" the report further said.Reliance Retail, with its 7,500 stores in 4,400 cities attracting more than 350 million footfalls, is among the country's largest and fastest-growing retail companies in the country.

Its market capitalisation rose to Rs 8,23,419 crore on BSE. The stock closed at 1,291 level on Monday amid report that Reliance Industries' telecom venture Jio beat Vodafone India to become the second-largest telco by revenue market share, closing the gap with market leader Bharti Airtel on this front.Mayuresh Joshi, fund manager at Angel Broking said, ""The stock has almost doubled in the period since the launch of the Reliance Jio business. The decision to sink over $20 billion into the telecom business has addressed the core issue of usage of cash. Petchem and refining were cash cows where most of the outlays have been completed. Reliance needed a new business with disruptive potential and that is where Jio fits in. In addition RIL has managed to maintain petchem margins at record levels. The GRMs in refining are also at a healthy premium over the Singapore benchmark. Additionally the retail business is also showing traction. The fact is that Jio has managed to disrupt mobile telephony by making data the center of attention. In the process, they have forced consolidation in the industry which will eventually drive customers to greater engagement. Going ahead a lot will depend on factors like pricing power? Price wars etc.""The stock had hit its 52-week low of 765 level on August 29, 2018.The stock logged the fourth-highest turnover on the BSE with the value of stocks traded on the BSE rising to Rs 13.74 crore.Rahul Sharma, senior technical research analyst at Equity99 said, ""The primary reasons for rise are RIL's increased its stake in Genesis Colors Ltd by over 3% and Jio's big ramp-up in subscriber additions and doubling of EBIDTA leading JIO to overtook telecom giant Vodafone in terms of revenue, becoming second-largest telecom player in India in revenue terms. This was supported by many other factors such as excellent set of numbers in Q1FY19 results (up 56% YoY), cascading effect of launch of JioFiber connectivity and so on.The stock has been historically undervalued. These recent developments have led the market to see stability in petro-chem business growth potential in telecom and retail, media and digital business. Today, RIL is India's most valued firm by market capitalization. The overall multiple is still on the lower side trading at P/E of around 22-23 on consolidated basis. Still Reliance as a group is a target of what we call as ""Conglomerate Discount"". Hence, these price levels are indeed sustainable and a further room for P/E to expand by 2-3 exists i.e. price levels of 1350-1400.""The stock has clocked 66% gains during the last one year and 41.14% rise since the beginning of this year.The stock has been gaining for the last seven days and has risen 8.29% during the period.The firm last week became the first Indian company to cross the Rs 8 lakh crore market capitalisation mark, racing ahead of Tata Sons' crown jewel TCS by more than Rs 20,000 crore in valuation.The market valuation of oil-to-telecom conglomerate crossed the $100-billion mark last month.

2018-09-26,"Never mind the rupee woes, oil fears, plunging Sensex and geopolitical troubles, the wealth creation rate in India is at an all-time high, according to the recently-released Barclays Hurun India Rich List for 2018. For instance, India's richest person Mukesh Ambani increased his wealth by Rs 300 crore per day over the past one year.The net worth of the chairman of Reliance Industries stood at Rs 3,71,000 crore as on July 31, 2018. Ambani continues to hold on to ""the top spot for the seventh year running on the back of a 47% rise in the share price of his flagship company"", said the report. In fact, his wealth is more than the combined wealth of the next three names on the latest rankings: New entrant SP Hinduja & Family with a net worth of Rs 1,59,000 crore, LN Mittal & Family (Rs 1,14,500 crore), and Wipro's Azim Premji (Rs 96,100 crore). The latter saw a 21% increase in his wealth. Barclays Hurun India Rich List is a compilation of the richest Indians - born or brought up in the country - having a net worth of Rs 1,000 crore or more. The number of individuals featured in the 2018 list increased by a third to 831 from 617 in 2017. More impressively, the number has doubled since the 2016 rankings. Dilip Sanghvi of Sun Pharma has dropped three ranks since last year and is now the 5th richest Indian on the list with a net worth of Rs 89,700 crore. According to the report, his loss in wealth in Suzlon, whose share value declined by more than 50%, was neutralised by minor gains in Sun Pharma's share price. With a wealth of Rs 78,600 crore, Uday Kotak, founder of Kotak Mahindra Bank, bagged the sixth place in the list, followed by Cyrus S Poonawalla of Serum Institute of India (Rs 73,000 crore) and Gautam Adani of Adani Enterprises (Rs 71,200 crore).Former Tata Sons' chairman Cyrus Pallonji Mistry and his brother Shapoor Pallonji Mistry share the 9th rank on the list with a net worth of Rs 69,400 crore each. The siblings have jumped three spots since last year courtesy a 41% increase in their wealth. And they can thank the 56% increase in TCS share price for that.Significantly, more than 50% of the Indian businesses listed in the 2018 rankings are family-run. Here are the top-10 richest Indian families: Although more than 20 cities in India are home to people on the list - led by Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru - the report added that Indian wealth creators are increasingly going global by way of expansion or emigration.The latest list includes 66 NRIs - up from 40 immigrants in the 2017 rankings - and a whopping 65% of them are self-made. With 21 individuals, UAE is the most preferred country for NRIs, followed by the US and the UK. Yusuff Ali MA, with a fortune of Rs 39,200 crore, is the wealthiest UAE-based NRI. The cumulative wealth of the 831 individuals featured in the list stood at $719 billion - amounting to a quarter of Indian GDP of $2,848 billion (as per IMF's estimate on April 1, 2018). There were 306 new names added to the list in the 2018 edition while 75 people dropped out.All the self-made entrepreneurs on the list under 40 years, except for Sanjay Agarwal of AU Small Finance Bank, derive their wealth from tech-based ventures. Though the average age of this group is 35 years, the youngest person is just 24 - Ritesh Agarwal, founder of OYO Rooms, India's newest unicorn.""Next 10 years in India would witness young and next generation entrepreneurs taking charge of the family business and the unicorn entrepreneurs cashing out and eventually becoming VC houses,"" the report said.Thirty-three-year-old Shradha Agarwal of Outcome Health is the only self-made female entrepreneur under 40 to make it to the list. But broadly-speaking women have fared far better in the latest rankings than ever before, with female representation up a whopping 157%. Unfortunately, in a testimony to the ever-present glass ceiling, the homogametic sex accounts for only 16% of the Rich List 2018.'Edited by Sushmita Agarwal",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/mukesh-ambani-increased-his-wealth-by-rs-300-crore-daily-last-year-barclays-hurun-report/story/282868.html
2018-07-31,"The behemoth headed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani has just snatched back the tag of the country's most valued company in terms of market capitalisation. As of 1 pm today, the m-cap of Reliance Industries (RIL) stood at Rs  7,47,644.67 crore, overtaking Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which stood at Rs 7,39,967.87 crore. The IT bellwether had first replaced RIL as the most valued firm more than five years ago. And, in the bargain, Ambani's net worth has also shot up, since he holds a 44.5 per cent stake in the company. According to Bloomberg data, he is now worth $45.9 billion, $1.6 billion richer in less than three weeks. RIL's stock has been on a roll since yesterday, after the company reported its highest ever quarterly net profit. The blue-chip scrip had jumped 2.4 per cent yesterday to touch a lifetime high of Rs 1,157.55 apiece on the BSE, and today it has set a new record, hitting a fresh peak of Rs 1181.35 in intraday trade. The stock is currently trading at Rs 1,179.90 per share, up 2.63 per cent. In comparison, TCS' shares are trading 0.72 per cent lower at Rs 1,931 apiece on the BSE. To remind you, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate reported consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore, or Rs 16 per share, in the April-June quarter, nearly 18 per cent higher than the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Revenue was up by 56.5 per cent at Rs 141,699 crore and gross refining margins (GRMs) stood at $10.5 per barrel, compared to $11.90 per barrel in the same quarter last year. The brokerages are bullish on RIL post the strong Q1 numbers. Goldman Sachs has the highest target of Rs 1,400 on the scrip while Nomura India's Rs 1,220 is the lowest among major foreign brokerages. Other brokerages such as CLSA (Rs 1,365), Citi (Rs 1,300) and HSBC (Rs 1,300) also see further upside on the stock. So shareholders have plenty of reason to bring out the bubbly.

2018-10-31,"While addressing shareholders in July, Mukesh Ambani portrayed the present era as the ""Golden Decade of Reliance"". His reasons - telecom start-up Reliance Jio posted profit in first year of commercial operations; earnings of the petrochemicals vertical grew to the size of Reliance Industries' (RIL's) biggest business, refining; and cash flow reached a level where the company can clear its net debt of Rs 1.8 lakh crore in less than three years.RIL recorded a 30.5 per cent rise in consolidated revenue to Rs 4,30,731 crore in 2017/18, thanks to onstreaming of greenfield petrochemicals projects at Jamnagar and rise in prices of refined petroleum products. The net profit rose 20.6 per cent to Rs 36,075 crore, largely because of high gross refining margins (GRM) of $11.6 a barrel. RIL became the second $100-billion company in July this year, following TCS. The average market capitalisation of the petroleum giant was Rs 6.27 lakh crore in the October 2017 to September 2018 period, higher than that of TCS.The ""Golden Decade"" has not come without challenges. Till a few years ago, Ambani's plan to enter digital services was taken lightly by telecom czars. The incumbents - Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea - were well placed and enjoying fat margins, advancing their operations to every nook and corner of the country at a fast clip.However, Reliance Jio launched its service in ways that were unheard of in 2016 - it made voice calls free, built an ultramodern digital ecosystem for boosting the data business and drastically brought down data rates. Average mobile phone bills of Indians fell to at least one-third after the arrival of Jio. The established players started bleeding and average revenue per user (ARPU) of telecom companies fell to Rs 79 in 2016/17, from Rs 123 in 2014/15. In June, the newly merged entity, Vodafone Idea, was the largest in the number of subscribers at 443.5 million, while Bharti Airtel (including Telenor and Tata) was second at 377 million. The two-year-old Jio was third with 215 million subscribers. In 2017/18, the first full year of commercial operations, Jio made a profit of Rs 723 crore on a revenue of Rs 20,154 crore. In the first six months of 2018/19, it reported a profit of Rs 1,293 crore on a revenue of Rs 17,349 crore. So far, RIL has spent Rs 2.5 lakh crore to build the telecom business. Besides, it is in the process of acquiring telecom assets of Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications apart from controlling stakes in two of India's largest cable TV and broadband service providers - Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks, as it seeks to ramp up coverage of its ambitious high-speed broadband network.Another big move is launch of fifth generation (5G) telecom services within six months of spectrum allocation. The government plans to allocate airwaves for 5G services - which support download speeds 50 to 60 times faster than 4G - by the end of 2019. Jio has a 5G-ready LTE network.Support FactorParallel to Jio, RIL made another huge investment, about Rs 1.5 lakh crore, to build the world's largest Refinery Off-gas Cracker and its downstream units and para-xylene (p-Xylene) plant. The timely investment helped the company offset declining margins at its flagship refining business, which registered a 18.2 per cent fall in refining earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at Rs 10,637 crore in the first six months of this financial year. GRMs fell from $11.9 a barrel to $9.9 a barrel during this period. However, the segment EBIT of petrochemicals business witnessed a record rise of 77.7 per cent to Rs 15,977 crore. This made petrochemicals the largest vertical in terms of cash flow for the first time. In the last financial year, the refining EBIT had grown just 3.2 per cent while petrochemicals EBIT had reported a 63 per cent rise.While RIL's hydrocarbon exploration and production continues to be in a shambles, Reliance Retail has shown signs of becoming a formidable force in the consumer retailing space. In 2017/18, the segment revenue increased 104.9 per cent to Rs 69,198 crore, while EBIT surged 163.3 per cent to Rs 2,064 crore. In the first six months of this financial year, the segment revenue rose 122.5 per cent to Rs 58,326 crore and EBIT 269.5 per cent to Rs 2,313 crore. Reliance Retail now has 9,146 stores with reach in 5,800 towns and cities. Ambani said at the AGM that Reliance has reached an inflection point. ""As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,"" he said.But there are some worries about RIL. The E&P business posted a negative EBIT of Rs 431 crore in the first half of this year and it is one of the major worries for investors. Some investors are also concerned about the delays in the $5 billion petcoke gasifier project.@nevinjl",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/indias-most-valuable-companies-2018/unstoppable/story/286841.html
2018-07-11,"Tripura CM Biplab Deb as the Science teacher, a gaushala as the science lab, Asaram, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and Radhe Maa as visiting professors, Jay Shah as the Accountancy professor, a degree in Jiology, Jiography and ENTIRE Political Science, and jobs awaiting for the graduates at the BJP IT Cell - these are only a few of the charms of Jio Institute, as Twitter would like you to believe. On Monday when HRD minister, Prakash Javadekar, announced that the Ambanis' Jio Institute has been selected for the status of 'Institution of Eminence', Twitterati cracked their knuckles and did what it does best - take digs and make jokes. More importantly, because Jio Institute, now at par with IIT Delhi, IIT Mumbai, IISC Bangalore and BITS Pilani is yet to be set up. Seems unbelievable? Twitter thinks so too! So, it took some amount of creative freedom and reimagined how Jio Institute would look like. News of Jio Institute's rise to eminence even before its existence created an uproar on social media. Netizens not only took digs at Jio Institute, Ambanis and the Modi government, who they believe are colluding to thrust the institute to the top, they also questioned the legitimacy of the four-member expert panel's decision. Jio Institute that will have Nita Ambani at its helm will be set up by the Reliance Foundation, Reliance Industries' philanthropic arm.According to the parameters, any institute making it to the Big 6 should include the following: 1. An IoE should offer interdisciplinary courses and carry research on ""areas of emerging technology.""2. It should have amenities comparable on the levels of globally reputed institutions and should have a mix of Indian and foreign students. So, netizens lost no time in criticising the decision to bestow the IoE tag on Jio Institute. Was it fair to club the institution that does not even exist with exemplary ones such as IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, IISC Bangalore, BITS Pilani and Manipal Academy of Higher Education? Why pay Reliance Industries belonging to the richest man in India Rs 1,000 crore when that money could very well be spent on other institutes? Were other applicants with poor track record bypassed for Jio Institute with no track record? And hence, netizens set to work.

2018-08-01,"Reliance Industries (RIL) won a significant victory against the government in a 20-month-long gas migration dispute yesterday. The case pertained to the Indian government's claim of a $1.55 billion penalty against RIL and its partners, UK-based BP Plc and Canada's Niko Resources, for allegedly syphoning gas from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin in the Bay of Bengal.An international arbitration tribunal, headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence Boo, rejected the government's claim by a majority of two votes to one. ""All the contentions of the Consortium [RIL, BP & Niko] have been upheld by the majority with a finding that the Consortium was entitled to produce all gas from its contract area and all claims made by the Government of India have been rejected. The Consortium is not liable to pay any amount to the Government of India,"" RIL said in a regulatory filing yesterday, adding, ""The Tribunal also awarded costs of $8.3 million (Rs 56.44 crore) to be paid by the Government of India to the Consortium"". On November 4, 2016, the oil ministry had slapped a demand of $1.47 billion on the RIL-BP-Niko consortium for ""unfairly"" producing natural gas belonging to ONGC. The government had claimed that the consortium had produced about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from adjoining ONGC's blocks into their KG-D6 block over seven years ending March 31, 2016. The Mukesh Ambani-led behemoth is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko. After deducting $71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and charging interest at the rate of LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate) plus 2 per cent - amounting to $149.86 million - a total demand of $1.55 billion was made on the consortium. The government's compensation claim for ""the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained"" flowed from the findings of the Justice (retd) AP Shah Committee. The one-man committee had been set up to look into the issue after ONGC first sued RIL for drawing gas that seeped from its block back in May 2015. The committee's report, submitted in August 2016, concluded that there has been ""unjust enrichment"" to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) - i.e. RIL and its partners - due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML.RIL, in turn, disputed the government's demand as being based on a ""misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC [Production Sharing Contract "", and claimed that such a demand was without precedent in the oil and gas industry. A week later, the consortium issued an arbitration notice.Without wasting any time, the three-member arbitration panel was constituted last February. Boo, the head of the Singapore-based Arbitration Chambers, was appointed as president of the tribunal by its two other members -former Supreme Court Judge GS Singhvi, who was the government's arbitrator, and RIL-appointed arbitrator former English High Court Justice Bernard Eder.While this is a major victory for RIL - and its stock has celebrated by touching a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1202.95 apiece on the BSE in intraday trade - the company may not be able to enjoy it for long. A top government functionary told Mint that the government intends to challenge the arbitration tribunal's decision. ""We will challenge it. Whatever is the process after arbitration we will follow it,"" said the source. In a similar vein, a senior ONGC executive told the daily that ""In all probability, the arbitration's decision will be challenged"".RIL's troubles don't end there. The government is reportedly also pressing the company to cough up $174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed after the output from the KG-D6 block was lower than the target. Profit petroleum refers to profits from gas production after recovering costs that is available for sharing between the contractors and the government. Significantly, disallowing cost recovery will result in the government's profit share rising. The cost recovery issue is reportedly being arbitrated separately.With PTI inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/big-victory-for-reliance-industries-in-ongc-gas-dispute-as-tribunal-rejects-govts-claim/story/280861.html
2018-12-18,"The world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, and richest Indian Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries are discussing joint investment in petrochemicals and refinery projects, the Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said. Al-Falih, who has known Ambani for over a decade now, travelled to Udaipur earlier this month to attend the pre-wedding festivities of Ambani's daughter Isha's marriage with Ajay Piramal's son Anand.During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week. In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani. At the meeting ""we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects."" He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on December 8 and 9.No details of the meeting were available from Reliance. Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry sources said. Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world's fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces. Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co (ADNOC) have picked up 50 per cent stake in a planned USD 44-billion refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.Aramco and ADNOC will together hold 50 per cent stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) refinery and adjacent 18 MTPA petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025. The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery. Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world's third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas. India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonnes. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonnes by 2040.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/mukesh-ambani-reliance-industries-in-talks-with-saudi-arabia-for-new-refinery-project/story/301918.html

The Mumbai-based firm became the second Indian firm to achieve this feat with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) retaining the top slot. Since 2013, TCS was the most valued firm in terms of M-cap with over Rs 4 trillion pushing RIL to the second slot.

2018-04-06,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio did not only disrupt the telecom industry but also saved Rs 60,000 crores in annual savings for India. The number was put out in a report by the Institute for Competitiveness in March this year. It said that the saving happened due to lower tariffs on data services that led to massive consumption. ""Within six months of Jio's launch, India became the highest mobile data user in the world, consuming over 1 billion GB of data every month compared to 200 million GB earlier,"" the IFC claimed in its report. Explaining the methodology to reach this number, IFC said: ""Taking a conservative estimate that every consumer uses 1 GB of data a month, we can calculate the financial gains to the economy by estimating the benefit to all 350 million internet subscribers of the country.""However, the report claims that the most recent estimates of the Jio network show that its users on an average consume almost 10 GB of data, 700 minutes of voice and 134 hours of video every month.  Such levels of digital consumption were unprecedented a year and a half ago, the IFC said. The rise in data consumption was a result of improved accessibility and affordability of internet offered by the new entrant. ""Jio has managed to change the face of the Indian telecom industry by changing the basis of competition from being voice-based to a data-based platform,"" the report said. The IFC has also claimed that the econometric analysis shows that Reliance Jio would boost -if everything in the economy remains constant- India's GDP by about 5.65 per cent. Last year in March, it was reported that Reliance Jio's promotional offers may have robbed the government of almost Rs 800 crore in revenue. The report emerged after the government saw massive decline in its revenue from licence fee. The government collects licence fees and spectrum usage charges from operators, which are calculated on the basis of their revenue. However, Jio's free promotional offers forced other telecom companies to bring down their charges, leading to a drop in their revenue. Later, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak in a letter asked the Trai to restrict the period of 'promotional tariffs' offered by telecom companies. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani launched the Group's telecom venture in September 2016. So far, Reliance has spent more than USD 31 billion to break into India's telecom market. Earlier in a speech, Ambani said that in less than two years India has become the number 1 country in mobile broadband usage. ""Jio users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month and that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day,"" he had said.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/mukesh-ambani-reliance-jio-rs-60000-crores-india-ifc/story/274269.html

Of these, MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.While the company did not provide any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields that have witnessed output drop to a fourth of peak, sources privy to the development said MA field may be shut as early as October after the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field, expires.E-mails sent to RIL and its partner BP plc of UK, which holds 30 per cent stake, for comments remained unanswered.The government's Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities.In the presentation, RIL said ""average production of gas (from KG-D6 block in January-March 2018) was 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day and oil and condensate was at 1,865 barrels per day."" The gas output, which was lower than 4.9 mmscmd in the October-December quarter of 2017, was made up of output from D1 and D3 and MA fields. It said this was due to ""continuing natural decline"" at the fields.RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in less than a decade.KG-D6 fields had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down wells. This peak output comprised 66.35 mmscmd from D1 and D3, the largest of the gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field.Besides the fall in output from D1 and D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped.RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak ouput.

Of the votes polled, 98.5 per cent were in favour of the resolution while 1.48 voted against it.According to the resolution, Ambani will be paid an annual salary of Rs 4.17 crore and Rs 59 lakh of perquisites and allowances. Retirement benefits are not included in the overall ceiling of remuneration.He will also be entitled to receive bonus based on net profits and ""expenses incurred for travelling, boarding and lodging, including for spouse and attendant(s) during business trips and provision of car(s) for use on company's business and communication expenses at residence shall be reimbursed at actuals and not considered as perquisites,"" it said.Also, ""the expenses, as may be borne by the company for providing security to Shri Mukesh D Ambani and his family members shall not be considered as perquisites and accordingly, not to be included for the purpose of computation of the overall ceiling of remuneration,"" the resolution, which was carried at the AGM, said.After Dhirubhai Ambani's demise on July 6, 2012, Mukesh was elected Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, while younger brother Anil was elected Vice Chairman and MD.The two siblings parted ways in 2005 and divided the business their father created between them.At the AGM, shareholders also allowed RIL to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to the regulatory filing.RIL wants to ""offer or invite subscriptions for secured / unsecured redeemable non-convertible debentures, in one or more series / tranches, of an aggregate nominal value up to Rs 20,000 crore, on private placement, from such persons and on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the company may, from time to time, determine and consider proper and most beneficial"".The company did not say where the proceeds will be utilised.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/mukesh-ambani-named-reliance-chairman-for-another-5-years/story/280009.html
2018-10-26,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries' acquisition of majority stakes in Hathway Cable and DEN Networks Ltd will impact broadcasters and direct-to-home (DTH) players negatively, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said on Friday. After disrupting the mobile data market with Jio, RIL is on its way to roll-out fibre-to-the-home broadband service called Jio GigaFiber. India Ratings (Ind-Ra) said the consolidation in the multiple system operators (MSO) space will hurt broadcasters as their bargaining power to command higher subscription revenue may be impacted. It also said that possibility of Reliance Jio (RJio) to offer bundled plan, which will include both the broadband and pay cable TV markets, would negatively impact DTH players.Reliance through its network of subsidiaries has acquired 58.92 per cent in Den networks and 51.34 per cent in Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited. Hathway enjoys over 52 per cent share of the total multiple system operators (MSOs) cable broadband market in India with 7.7 lakh subscribers, and has the ability to reach 5.5 million homes. The acquisition enables RJio to gain a significant foothold across western, central and northern India, according to the rating agency.Hathway has a major presence in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and RIL will also acquire a minority stake in GTPL Hathway, which has a strong presence in Gujarat and West Bengal. Den Networks has a significant presence in northern India, it explained.The acquisition will give RIL direct access to MSOs' vast broadband infrastructure and large pool of pay cable TV subscribers, it said, adding the company can use this last mile connectivity to accelerate Reliance Jio Infocomm's foray into the fibre-to-the-home market.""On the other hand, the deal will resolve four big challenges facing MSOs - high leverage, large capex requirements for broadband roll-out, lack of a wide spectrum of content and competition threat from RJio,"" it said.According to India Ratings, the rationale for the deal is to shorten the time horizon for RJio's fibre-to-the-home foray as either competing or partnering with the highly fragmented local cable operator (LCO) universe would be a time-consuming process.The rating agency further said that RJio's aggressive marketing could lead to an expansion in the broadband market, somewhat similar to the one that took place in the wireless mobile data market.The deal gives RJio direct access to around 6.5 million broadband households (home-pass), which represents about 36 per cent of the country's total fixed broadband subscriber base of about 18 million, according to the agency.It will also get access to close to 12.5 million cable TV subscribers (nearly 7 per cent of total TV households), who may not have broadband connectivity yet, it added.India Ratings believes that that RJio's target to reach 50 million household over the next three to four years looks achievable through the acquired subscribers of MSOs, higher penetration in existing markets and possible aggressive tariffs for other geographies.The subscriber base of 50 million household, at the current monthly broadband tariff of Rs 500-600 per household, represents a Rs 30,000-36,000 crore market for RJio, it estimated.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/how-ril-acquisition-of-hathway-cable-den-networks-hurts-rivals/story/286674.html

Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries had touched the Rs 8-lakh crore mark on August 23, becoming the first Indian company to do so.During the intra-day trading, the TCS share surged 2 per cent to a record high of Rs 2,097 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), taking its m-cap to Rs 8,01,550.50 crore.TCS was the first Indian company to cross the Rs 7-lakh crore market cap in June after it crossed the $100 billion milestone in April. Its market valuation had gone past the Rs 6-lakh crore level earlier this year, making it the second company to achieve the milestone after Reliance Industries.Its stock has gained around 54.6 per cent this year. The stock has seen a continuous rise due to share buyback offer worth over Rs 16,000 crore by the company from September 6 to September 21. Under the offer, TCS has decided to buyback total 76.19 million shares for Rs 2,100 a piece.While RIL is the first homegrown major to achieve this feat, the aggregate market capitalisation of 15 Tata Group companies comes out to be around Rs 11.32-lakh crore. Also, the collective valuation of Deepak Parekh-led financial services company, HDFC Group, had also crossed Rs 10-lakh crore recently. Companies offer share buyback when they want to boost the overall share value or to reduce the number of shares in the market or to stop other shareholders from taking control of the company.

2018-06-07,"Over the past decade, India's richest man Mukesh Ambani has voluntarily missed out on almost Rs 24 crore each year to set an example.

Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, has been set at Rs 15 crore, reflecting his desire to continue to set a personal example for moderation in managerial compensation levels,"" Reliance Industries said in its latest annual report, released yesterday.His remuneration for 2017-18 included Rs 4.49 crore as salary and allowances, which is marginally higher than the Rs 4.16 crore he received in financial year 2016-17. The commission has remained unchanged at Rs 9.53 crore while perquisites have declined to Rs 27 lakh from Rs 60 lakh. Retirement benefits stood at Rs 71 lakh.However, Ambani has not enforced his decision on others in his company. The remunerations of all other whole-time directors show handsome raises in the year ending March 2018. For example, Ambani's cousins Nikhil Meswani and Hital Meswani saw their compensation rise to Rs 19.99 crore each.

2018-04-30,"Reliance Industries' petrochemical division has overtaken oil refining to become the largest earnings contributor segment for the company, brokerage firms said applauding the firm's robust earnings in FY18, saying the best is yet to come.In comments on RIL's January-March and 2017-18 fiscal year earning statement, HSBC said strong petchem performance was offset by telecom arm Jio earning lower-than-expected average revenue per user.RIL's Q4 earnings were driven by strong petchem performance that came from higher volumes from new paraxylene, refinery offshore caracker (ROGC) and downstream units, and higher margins from polypropylene, polyester and fiber intermediate products.Jio subscriber net additions remain strong at 26.5 million during the quarter but results a miss due to lower-than-expected average revenue per user at Rs 137, it said adding refining margins dipped to $11 per barrel due to lower throughput and adverse Brent-Dubai differential.Goldman Sachs said, ""The key driver of growth was the petrochemical division, which grew 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter, and is now the largest segment earnings contributor, overtaking refining.""Refining margins missing forecasts were offset by strong growth momentum from the retail business. Revenues from Jio were in-line with estimates with higher subscribers offsetting lower average revenue per user (ARPU), it said.""With the shares continuing to do well investors may wonder whether earnings momentum has already played out and shares are fully valued. However, we believe the best is yet to come,"" it said.Goldman said it expects pre-tax profit or EBITDA to further grow by 35 per cent in the year to March 31, 2019 after growth of 40 per cent in 2017-18 fiscal. Growth will largely be driven by the petchem business reaching full earnings power in the coming quarter while growth momentum from Jio and retail will continue, it said.With earnings power of new projects evident during FY19, RIL is expected to generate USD 6 billion in free cash flow as capex in both the core business and the wireless business is largely done.""We expect management to use free cash flow to pare down leverage, which has increased versus history,"" it said.Citi said RIL's 3 of the 4 downstream expansions have now fully stabilised and ramped up. ""Phase 1 of petcoke gasification is currently under stabilisation, while phase 2 of the gasifiers is under commissioning,"" it said adding as Jio's first stage of 4G coverage nears completion, the focus has shifted to Fiber to the home (FTTH) and enterprise (commercial launch shortly, but will be gradual.Morgan Stanley said with new projects all underway, earnings have begun to fire on most cylinders with a downstream upcycle and crude price tailwinds. ""RIL's energy earnings remain amongst the most stable of global peers and continue to anchor growth, while retail/telecom rapidly raise domestic leadership.""While Q4 petrochemical segment earnings reflected the impact of full downstream chemical integration, rising polyester spreads and cheap ethane feedstock, oil refining was good but can be better, it said.On telecom earnings, it said RIL has cited traction of higher-priced plans with lower-end subscribers (Jiophone), as data usage remains largely at par with other users.""Is there an end to investments? This has been a key investor question, and we see some anecdotal evidence of capex intensity falling: 1) energy capex appears largely behind as petcoke gasifiers have started operations; and 2) telecom capex (60 per cent of total in F18) on mobility is mostly done, with a focus on rolling broadband/wireline services starting this quarter,"" it added.BofAML said Q4 petchem EBITDA of Rs 7,700 crore exceeded that of refining (Rs 6400 crore).It said at the analyst meet, Reliance reiterated that Jio is a digital services business (not just telecom), for which they need to acquire customers and that Jio cannot be short - term focused (having invested $35 billion). Jio are likely to launch their Fiber to Home services over the coming weeks (in phases).Kotak Securities said expected growth trajectory to slow down until Jio picks up, given near full utilization of petchem projects, limited upside to downstream margins and likely subdued contribution from gasifiers.CLSA said while Jio's revenue missed forecast by 1-2 per cent as higher subscribers were offset by lower average per user revenue, it was another stellar quarter for retail with revenue more than doubling, pre-tax profit nearly tripling.Deutsche Bank said over the next six months, the commissioning of projects in its energy business and ramp-up of monetisation at Jio should maintain the outperformance.The contribution from expansions and robust downstream margins should drive RIL's EBITDA growth of 24 per cent CAGR over FY18-20.Nomura said as FY19 will see full benefits of several key projects like ROGC (refinery off-gas cracker) and downstream, PX, ethane imports etc, the profitability should further improve.The much awaited Petcoke gasification is also nearing commercial start. As per management, the phase-1 of four gasifiers in domestic tariff area (DTA) refinery are under-stabilization / optimisation, and commercial production is likely to start soon. The phase-2 of six gasifiers in special economic zone (SEZ) refinery are also mechanically complete, and should commission over next 6 months.UBS said although the petchem, retail and Jio performance was slightly better than expected, investors may question continuation of $3.2 billion in quarterly capital expenditure and increase in net debt which could lead to weakness in the share price.BNP said RIL was very firm about the strategy going forward on Jio, which continues to be focused on customer acquisition and is open to further tariff cuts based on the actions of the incumbents. However, pricing does remain an important determinant for the long term success of the business.",https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/reliance-industries-earnings-reliance-jio-oil-refining/story/275956.html

2018-05-31,"The Reliance Communications (RCom) stock rose up to 20 per cent today, a day after National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) stayed bankruptcy proceedings against the company after it agreed to pay Rs 550 crore to Ericsson to settle a payment dispute. The stock closed 5.71% higher at 18.50 on the BSE. It opened at 19.25 level today and hit an intra day high of 20.85 level on the BSE. The stock has been gaining for the last five days and has risen 30.74% during the period. It opened with a gain of 10% today. The stock is down 7.50% during the last one year. It has fallen 48.92% since the beginning of this year. Anil Ambani's beleaguered telecom company on Tuesday came out with a fresh offer of Rs 500-crore upfront payment to Ericsson to settle the matter. While hearing the matter on Wednesday, the tribunal asked RCom and its subsidiaries to pay Rs 550 crore as part of the settlement with Ericsson within the next 120 days (by September end) from June 1, failing which the insolvency proceedings would be started against the company. The order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal clears the way for Anil Ambani-led RCom to sell its telecom towers, spectrum and fibre assets to Reliance Jio. A two-member bench headed by NCLAT Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya directed RCom and its subsidiaries Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom to pay Rs 550 crore to Ericsson India in 120 days, failing which it will direct insolvency proceedings against the company. Meanwhile, in a statement yesterday, RCom said its management has been reinstated by NCLAT's order.""RCom's management and board of directors have been reinstated vide this order,"" RCom spokesperson said.""RCom expects to now complete the sale of its assets within the next few weeks, having removed legal hurdles of cases by minority investors of RITL, and Ericsson, thereby achieving an overall debt reduction of approximately Rs 25,000 crore from the first phase of its asset monetisation programme,"" he added.The appellate tribunal's decision comes as a relief for Anil Ambani's companies. The National Company Law Tribunal on May 15 had triggered the insolvency process against the debt-ridden company after Ericsson registered three separate applications against these companies over the non-payment of dues worth Rs 978 crore, which now total around Rs 1,600 crore. RCom owes around Rs 45,000 crore to as many as 31 domestic and international banks, including over Rs 10,000 crore to a Chinese lender. Due to mounting losses, the company began to wind down its mobile operations from last November. It was also not servicing the debt for many quarters before that as it was looking to recast the loans but did not materialise and since then many of its creditors had taken RCom to bankruptcy court. This has prevented the company from closing sale of its telecom tower business to Anil Ambani's elder brother-run Reliance Industries for over Rs 23,000 crore, apart from monetising other assets including selling its sprawling DAKC premises to the Chinese lender and pares debt.",https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/reliance-communications-stock-rises-nclat-bankruptcy-proceedings-ericsson/story/278156.html

""Pursuant to the voting, the Resolution Plan has received the assent of 72.192 per cent of the voting share of the CoC,"" RIL said in a regulatory filing.The committee of creditors of Alok Industries had earlier rejected Reliance's resolution plan for acquiring the firm in partnership with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. RIL-JM Financial ARC was the sole bidder and its initial offer of Rs 4,950 crore in April was rejected on the grounds that it was too low.According to a report in The Economic Times, RIL-JM Financial improved its bid by Rs 100 crore in second round and offered to pay  Rs 5,050 crore --  an amount which is 83 per cent less than the total dues of Rs 29,500 crore.Under the IBC, a resolution plan needs approval from at least 66 per cent of the lenders to be eligible for the next stage, which is the NCLT's approval.

2018-06-13,"Is it worthwhile investing in the Indian telecom sector? Japan's NTT DoCoMo would reply in the negative. In 2009, DoCoMo acquired a 26.5 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices (TTSL) for $2.7 billion. The agreement stated that if TTSL failed to achieve certain milestones in five years, the Tatas would find a buyer for the shares held by DoCoMo or buy that stake at a 50 per cent discount. Last October, DoCoMo took a hit when the Tatas paid it about $1.27 billion, 47 per cent of the deal amount, and that too after a three-year fight with Indian regulators. At the same time, the share price had fallen much below the agreed value. The actual erosion was, in fact, much higher.In 2008, Norwegian operator Telenor joined hands with realty firm Unitech, which had acquired nationwide spectrum in 2008. The venture started with huge losses but Telenor was hopeful of making money in the long term. It bought a majority stake (67.25 per cent) from Unitech for $1.3 billion and also invested in the 2G network. It lost all its licences when the Supreme Court revoked 122 licences in 2012 in the 2G scam case. It returned after acquiring six licences in the November 2012 auction. However, after Reliance Jio started offering free voice calls, it lost out. After spending billions, it exited India, selling the venture to Airtel.Telecom, a sunrise sector till not too long ago, has become a graveyard for service providers, both domestic and international. A highly competitive industry with over a dozen operators till a few years ago is now down to three large private operators - Bharti Airtel, the Vodafone-Idea combine and Reliance Jio - apart from state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam.The sheer scale of value destruction that has accompanied this is mind-blowing. Over the past few years, over `1 lakh crore investment has gone down the tube, while more than one lakh people are reported to have lost their jobs. The sector's gross revenue fell 8.56 per cent to `2.55 lakh crore between 2016 and 2017, according to sector regulator Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Adjusted gross revenue fell 18.87 per cent, licence fee earnings 18.78 per cent and spectrum usage charges 32.81 per cent during the period.Telecom was not a hellhole that it is now till not too long ago. Till 2008, entry barriers were low, spectrum was cheaper, scale wasn't that important and government favoured competition. That led to not just large domestic companies like the Tatas, Aditya Birla Group, Reliance Industries, but also smaller players such as Videocon, Unitech and DB Group with interests in unrelated industries taking a plunge. Even when the Supreme Court cancelled 122 licences in 2012, many decided to slug it out.But things changed dramatically with Reliance Jio launching 4G services in September 2016. It started by offering free services for six months. Later, while offering voice for free, it came up with low-priced data plans. With voice - close to 70 per cent revenues of telecom players becoming free - the pressure on incumbents started building up. Their future now depended on offering high-speed data at low rates. Considering that the incumbents already had a debt of over `2.5 lakh crore, they found it difficult to compete against an entity loaded with cash.This started the exit by smaller operators and led to the merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular, which were till then the biggest after market leader Bharti Airtel. Smaller telcos that couldn't compete with Jio shut shop before it was too late. Telenor and Tata Teleservices sold their businesses to Airtel.It was not just the magnitude of Jio's spending - estimated at $31 billion - but also the longevity of its attack that made the life of small telcos miserable. After all, the total Jio investment is more than the combined investment of half a dozen small operators. The disruption has also hurt bigger players such as Airtel. The only difference is that they have the ability to bear losses for an extended period. Also, exiting a business is not easy in India.Wealth ErosionLast year, Anil Ambani made a public appearance in the middle of a crisis at RCom and made a clarion call for the sector. He said the sector is in an ICCU (intensive coronary care unit). While citing the example of the ""mighty"" Tatas which, Ambani said, had to ""gift away"" their telecom business to Airtel, he said several operators had seen value erosion and large losses over the year. He was pointing at frenetic M&A activity in the sector reducing the number of private players to just three. But this was not the only reason. Starting 2010, the government went on a spectrum sale overdrive to meet revenue targets. In has held auctions in six out of the last eight years, garnering `3.55 lakh crore. Smaller telcos, including Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, MTS, Telenor, Videocon and Aircel, spent `54,679 crore in these auctions. Experts estimate that they spent an equal amount on building their networks. After a cumulative investment of around `1.1 lakh crore, these companies have been sold for about `30,928 crore (excluding Aircel, which has filed for bankruptcy). Though this includes deferred spectrum payments to the government (which will be paid by the new buyers), experts estimate wealth erosion of `50,000-60,000 crore for smaller telcos alone.The bigger incumbents - Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular - have also suffered. ""The prices have gone down so much that it has impacted revenues. The bigger guys benefitted on account of smaller players who sold their businesses at a loss,"" says Tanu Sharma, Associate Director (Corporates), India Ratings & Research.In a November 2017 note, India Ratings noted that ""the wherewithal to survive has been diminishing for smaller telcos ever since Jio entered the telecom landscape. The exit of smaller telcos is good for the industry structure in the long term but painful for the stakeholders, including lenders.""The amount of stressed assets and non-performing assets (NPAs) in telecom is staggeringly high. Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla told Lok Sabha in March that telecom gross NPAs stood at `11,028 crore. A few days prior to that, former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram had said that telecom and power contributed to the NPA problem more than anything else due to the 'malicious twist' given to the UPA government's policies governing these sectors.Sanjeev Krishan, Partner and Leader Deals, PwC India, says the NPAs could be far higher than what has been reported, and a clearer picture will emerge over the next two quarters. ""The stress has been evident for a quite few years, both with the telcos and infrastructure owners, and particularly after the cancellation of 2G licences. Some of the telecom businesses are part of larger conglomerates and have had backing from their promoter groups. The underlying economics of the business has changed and as a result, the level of sustainable debt for a number of these businesses is a fraction of the overall debt they are carrying,"" he says.The crunch has also led to big job losses. Different agencies give different figures. Bangalore-based human resources consulting firm CIEL HR says 80,000-90,000 jobs were lost in 2017/18, substantially higher than the 40,000 layoffs in 2016/17.""Seven years ago, telecom companies were at their peak in revenues. Since then, hike in spectrum prices, increased competition and adverse regulations have weighed down on the sector. We still haven't seen the end of the consolidation phase,"" says S.P. Kochhar, CEO of the Telecom Sector Skill Council, adding that 20-25 per cent of the workforce will be laid off during consolidation. ""Manpower is being shed in areas like sales, maintenance, customer service, middle- and senior-level management.""Aditya Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR, says: ""Sales jobs have been axed because acquisition of new customers has slowed down and companies are cutting down on manpower costs.""""We are seeing telcos shutting down non-critical functions but companies cannot continue to lay off people as they are growing in size,"" says Amresh Nandan, Research Director, Gartner.Falling ApartSetting up a telecom business has never been as difficult as it is today. Jio is stifling competition on two fronts - scale and tariffs. But that wasn't always the case. Smaller telcos would buy 2G spectrum in a limited number of circles - typically where spectrum prices weren't as high as in the metros - and offer lower voice tariffs than the large telcos.Aircel, for instance, had more subscribers than Airtel, Vodafone and BSNL in Chennai and Tamil Nadu in 2016. Telenor India was the third-largest player in the UP (West), Gujarat and UP (East) and surpassed Airtel and Idea in some circles. ""Earlier, there was voice arbitrage. Everything is packaged into data now. The smaller players didn't have the capacity to offer high-speed data at low prices. They didn't have the ability to offer 4G services,"" says India Ratings & Research's Sharma.Experts say the technologies were changing fast and smaller telcos didn't have the wherewithal to keep investing. MTS India and Tata Teleservices (TTSL), for instance, had CDMA networks. TTSL also had GSM network in some circles. The CDMA technology is good for voice but not for data and transition from CDMA to GSM comes at a huge cost. ""CDMA operators were upgrading their data network by bringing in new technologies (MTS launched EV-DO Rev.B phase II) but the market shifted to LTE (4G), which resulted in loss of data customers to larger telcos,"" says Neil Shah, Research Director, Counterpoint.The smaller operators couldn't match the prices offered by Jio. ""Scandinavian companies keep a close watch on return on investment. Every business decision for them revolves around it,"" says a former Telenor executive. ""Aircel was good operationally but ran out of cash to invest in the network. After Jio entered the market, it lost subscribers every quarter. Videocon Telecom never invested in customer service and infrastructure. Before the sale to Airtel, they were in a death spiral,"" says Counterpoint's Shah.Exit IssuesSigning a deal is one thing but closing it is another matter, especially in India. Some fringe players might feel relieved after selling their businesses to larger telcos but finding an exit is far from reality for others. Aircel is struggling with mounting losses and high debt - estimated at around Rs 50,000 crore. Malaysia's Maxis-owned Aircel knocked the doors of the NCLT in February to file for bankruptcy. The insolvency professional and lenders of Aircel are looking at ways to revive services in some circles and raise capital.With so many failures in such a short span, and concentration of power in the hands of two to three operators, there's looming fear that the changing telecom landscape may put mobile phone consumers at a disadvantage and dissuade new players from taking a plunge. ""It's proven that telecom is a business of scale and only strong hands can compete. You need to have pan-India presence,"" says Bhupendra Tiwary, Research Analyst, ICICI Securities.S.K. Gupta, Secretary, TRAI, says that from the investment point of view, the sector is red-hot. ""Data growth in India is one of the highest in the world. It's a good place for anybody to come."" Also, with India not being homogenous, telcos are offering a standard product with variation in prices. ""Within prepaid, which is the largest segment, there can be many sub-segments. The sector has a lot of unutilised capacity, and there's a possibility of new operators coming in with specialised services for students, migrants, etc.,"" says Gartner's Nandan.All told, the telecom sector is in a shambles. It remains to be seen how things could change. The only hope is that things would turn for the better. That will depend on sensible policies and regulations that do not look to squeeze the sector. @manukaushik",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-hub/telecom-sector-docomo-tata-teleservices-telenor-unitech-jio-idea/story/278879.html
2018-07-14,"Eminent scientist Raghunath A Mashelkar is proposed to be the Chancellor of Jio Institute. Indian Express today reported that the Reliance Foundation has pitched Mashelkar's name to the government committee as the Chancellor of yet-to-be-established Jio Institute. According to the report, Dipak C Jain, former director of Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration in Bangkok, will serve as the Vice-Chancellor of the Institute. Mashelkar and Jain are members of the board at Reliance Industries. Raghunath A Mashelkar, who is also the chairman of the Reliance Innovation Council, is an eminent scientist and President of Global Research Alliance. Earlier, he served as the Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research for eleven years. Mashelkar is currently the Chairman of India's National Innovation Foundation under the Department of Science and Technology. According to the Indian Express, the Board of Management, headed by the V-C, will govern the institute's administration. It will also have the Provost, Dean Research, Executive Vice President and nominees of the GC and Reliance Foundation as its members, the report said. Earlier this week, the government granted ""Institution of Eminence"" status to IIT-Delhi, IIT-Bombay and Indian Institute of Science in the public sector, and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, BITS-Pilani and Jio Institute in the private sector. The selection of the Jio Institute - which doesn't even exist - as one of the six Institutions of Eminence drew sharp criticism from various quarters with many questioning the process of selection and the motive behind it.The Ministry of Human Resource Development later clarified how Jio Institute was accorded such coveted status despite having no physical infrastructure in place.  According to the government, Jio Institute has been given this tag under Greenfield Project - purpose of which is to allow responsible private investment to build global class educational infrastructure. There were four parameters on which all applications were judged. According to the Ministry, Jio Institute satisfied all the four parameters, and hence was recommended for issuing a letter of intent for setting up an Institute of Eminence.Earlier it was reported that RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani led the team that convinced the government committee to pick Jio Institute as one of the country's six Institutes of Eminence. Jio Institute is to be set up on an 800-acre campus in Karjat in Maharashtra.",https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/reliance-proposed-board-member-r-a-mashelkar-as-the-chancellor-of-jio-institute-report/story/280283.html
2018-04-05,"Reliance Jio Infocomm had made headlines in January this year when it had declared a profit in its third quarter results, just 16 months after its launch. According to analysts, its January to March quarter results for the last financial year may not show much of a change in terms of net profit, but the telecom disruptor will continue to give a tough competition to older rivals like Airtel and Idea Cellular.According to The Economic Times, analysts predict that Jio's Q4FY18 net profit will remain flat sequentially at around Rs 504 crore, courtesy an around 3 per cent rise in revenue to Rs 7,100 crore. Operating income is pegged to grow 1.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 2,670 crore. The robust subscription to its loyalty programme Prime, meanwhile, is likely to continue. ICICI Securities reportedly estimates Jio's Prime membership revenue to jump as much as 80 per cent to Rs 900 crore in the March quarter, up from Rs 500 crore in Q3.On the flip side, it expects Jio to report ""an 11.1 per cent sequential fall in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 137 in the March quarter from Rs 154 in the October-December period"", triggered by the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users at Rs 49 per month and users moving to lower-priced bundled plans. Its Ebitda margin is expected to slightly dip too.Despite this Jio is expected to continue to outperform its rivals. Shockingly, Airtel, the country's leading telco, is likely staring at its first quarterly net loss in 15 years. Jio's latest round of price-cuts in January, the impact of the recent 43 per cent drop in international termination charges and continuing ARPU downtrading are all expected to cause a sharp revenue decline for Airtel as well as the other incumbents in the last quarter of 2017-18. Significantly, the brokerage reportedly sees Jio's subscriber base increasing to 185 million in its Q4 results, a whopping 15.6 per cent sequential jump over the previous quarter. So how long is Jio going to continue with its disruptive pricing? ""As the market heads towards a three-player structure (amid ongoing sector consolidation), Jio's behaviour would change once it approaches 30 per cent RMS [revenue market share], which may happen by end-FY19, and could be a point at which we would expect slightly less price competition in the market,"" Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecom analyst, told the daily.

RADL is a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure and operates five regional airports in Maharashtra, at Nanded, Latur, Baramati, Yavatmal and Osmanabad.In its statement, Reliance said that application for land at Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport, Nagpur was filed in August 2015. Payments were made for this plot between August 2015 and July 2017, which was then used for Dassault-Reliance Aerosapce (DRAL).

2018-12-13,"Last month, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani had announced that his company is working on creating the world's largest online-to-offline new commerce platform that would integrate the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with Jio's infrastructure and services. In order to boost this ecommerce venture's last-mile connectivity, Ambani plans to utilise the telco's 5,100-plus smaller Jio Point stores in more than 5,000 cities and towns, The Economic Times reported.Reliance Retail would set up ecommerce kiosks in the Jio Point stores from where store executives will help consumers place orders, senior executives aware of the development told the daily. The company will undertake assisted sales of everything from daily provisions like sugar, pulses, soaps and biscuits to apparel from these stores leveraging the telco's distribution network, which already reaches these stores to supply SIM cards, mobile handsets and accessories. They added that the ecommerce venture is likely to take off by April next year.""Potentially, they can sell anything using this network which has a shelf life and doesn't require installation service. The customer can pick up the product from the Jio Point or store executives can deliver it to them [at their doorsteps],"" said a source. The idea is to reach out to 95% of India's population directly - including consumers without Internet access, as well as those who have never shopped online - which will only be possible through the omnichannel route.Also Read: Why Reliance Jio's tariff war that has singed Airtel, Vodafone, Idea refuses to endJio Point stores already account for 10% of Reliance Retail's overall consumer electronics sales, so the company now reportedly plans to extend the same model to grocery, personal care, apparel and shoes. ""The company wants to have a retail presence through ecommerce in towns with population over 10,000, which would mean a presence across 95-98% of India's consumer base,"" the source added.Moreover, given the rapidly mushrooming Jio Points, Reliance Retail is looking at a huge distribution network. According to the daily, Reliance adds over 500 new such stores every quarter and is targetting 50,000 Jio Point stores across India, which will operate as customer sales and service touch points for Jio. Reliance Retail's plans to tap the Tier 2 and beyond markets is understandable given the market's potential. According EY India's latest report, the rural market for e-commerce in India is likely to be a $10-12 billion opportunity in the next four years. The report further estimated that total ecommerce sales in the country are likely to grow at 32% CAGR between 2017 and 2021.But Ambani will have a stiff fight on his hands, with biggies like Amazon India and Walmart-backed Flipkart also aggressively participating in the omnichannel battle. Amazon, for instance, launched Project Udaan in 2015. This is the etailer's assisted shopping programme for rural and semi-urban areas that has reached out to more than 12,000 mom-and-pop stores. Then there's the 'I Have Space' programme under which Amazon India partners with local store owners to provide last mile pick-up and delivery services to customers.Also Read: Airtel to team up with Vodafone Idea to co-own fibre network to take on Reliance JioAlso Read: JioSaavn offers 90 days free premium service to Reliance Jio users",https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/reliance-retail-ecommerce-venture-plans-to-tap-the-5000-plus-jio-point-stores-report/story/300294.html
2018-07-29,"Exactly a decade after it started production, the MA oil and gas field in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-D6 will seize to produce from September, said Reliance Industries which has battled quicker than anticipated decline in output at a block that once was its pride.Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.""MA field cessation expected by September 2018,"" the company said in an investor presentation post announcing first-quarter earnings.The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation.MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 & D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 & D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.Output thereafter has only declined.Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 & D3 and MA fields.In April the company had stated that ""adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields"".While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September.The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.The government's Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities.Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output.

2018-03-16,"Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited, said that his daughter Isha had seeded the idea of telecom venture Jio in 2011. Talking at an award ceremony in London, Ambani, the richest Indian, said his daughter once complained about the slow internet speed, and this inspired him to enter the broadband internet arena.Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio), which was launched in September 2016, is the fourth largest carrier in India. Jio offers free lifetime voice call services and mobile data at dirt cheap rates. ""My children, Isha and Akash, belong to India's young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind,"" he said, while delivering his acceptance speech for the 'Drivers of Change' award at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards. He added that Indian mobile networks in 2011 suffered from poor connectivity and data packages were artificially priced at a premium, which made them unaffordable for most. With the entry of Jio, data was not only made abundant, but also accessible and affordable to all Indians. He went on to add that while the US and Europe had ushered 1G and 2G connectivity, respectively, before China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio's 4G LTE-only data network opened up new possibilities. ""Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India and will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,"" he said. ""The entire Indian telecom industry took 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. We (Jio) took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. We are also 5G-ready today,"" Ambani said. He has reportedly pumped in more than $31 billion to break into India's mobile-phone market. He said that Jio's endeavour with high-quality data at the lowest price in the world -- at almost one-tenth the prices of the US -- has resulted in the migration of 300,000 to 500,000 Indians daily on its network. ""This has made Jio the biggest start-up in India's history,"" said Ambani. He added that Jio is also offering the ""world's most affordable 4G LTE smartphone"" that is available for free with a deposit of Rs 1,500 in order to capture the feature phone market in India. ""In the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe's population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,"" he said, adding that with everyone getting access to internet, India will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything. Jio is also preparing itself to offer newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet. With Jio, India has jumped from 155 to No. 1 ranking, globally, in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years. Reliance Industries was felicitated for ""commitment to innovations and growth in the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services.""Ambani said that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original 'Driver of Change' in India's business history, stating that the legendary industrialist founded Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1966 with a meager capital of Rs 1,000.

2018-09-12,"Jio has been asked by telecom regulator TRAI to pay financial disincentive of Rs 34 lakh ""for not meeting certain call centre service parametres"", its parent firm RIL said. Reliance Jio will take necessary action after obtaining requisite clarification from TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said in a regulatory filing.""Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a subsidiary of the company, has received communication from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India regarding payment of financial disincentive of Rs 34 lakh for not meeting certain call centre service parameters,"" it said. Telecom operator Bharti Airtel had yesterday confirmed that it has received demand notices towards penalties totalling Rs 11 lakh for six circles - Maharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata and Gujarat - for the quarter ended March 2018.Airtel's penalties were on parameters such as accessibility of call centre, percentage of calls answered by the operators and metering and billing credibility, Airtel had informed in BSE filing. PTI had earlier reported that TRAI had imposed penalties on major telecom operators including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular (now merged), for slipping on various service quality benchmarks for the March 2018 quarter.

2018-07-19,"A week after Bharti Airtel was reportedly in talks with investment bankers to raise a syndicated overseas loan of $1 billion, perhaps as early as August, the buzz is that Reliance Industries (RIL) is shopping around to raise up to $2.5 billion in loans from overseas market.According to The Economic Times, RIL is negotiating with more than a dozen banks to arrange the loan in single or multiple tranches as it steps up pace of investments in telecom - Reliance Jio Infocomm has recently announced the launch of its fixed line broadband service, JioGigaFiber - and retail businesses.A source told the daily that the loan was aimed at refinancing existing offshore debt raised about two-and-half years ago and would reduce average borrowing cost or extent maturities. It is expected to be priced between 100 and 125 basis points above Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) with a likely tenor of 3-5 years.This development comes about a month after Jio tapped the Korean credit market to raise $1 billion from Korea Trade Insurance Corporation. In addition, the company has recently raised Rs 2,500 crore by selling domestic corporate bonds and another $500 million through a syndicated Samurai loan from three Japanese banks.Airtel, similarly, seems to be pulling out all stops to take on the deep-pocketed Jio. Over the past year the telco has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, to cut debt and free up cash for its capex investments. The latter is pegged at Rs 24,000 crore in the current fiscal in order to expand its 4G networks and maintain Airtel's lead in the race. The Sunil Mittal-led company has reportedly raised over Rs 14,000 crore so far.It is now reportedly looking at monetising its profitable Africa operations. According to the daily, Airtel is in talks with US-based PE firm Warburg Pincus to raise $1.25-1.5 billion by divesting a 10-15 per cent stake in its Netherlands-based unit, BAIN BV, which controls its Africa operations.  This development comes seven months after Airtel's announcement that Warburg Pincus will acquire up to a 20 per cent stake in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia for about $350 million.To remind you, Airtel entered the African market in June 2010 after it stuck a deal with Zain's mobile operations in 15 African countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Niger, which are among the continent's biggest and fastest-growing economies. BAIN (Bharti Airtel International Netherlands) BV is the company's wholly-owned subsidiary and the holding company of the Africa operations.""The proposed transaction is a precursor to its planned listing [on international stock exchanges] of the African business in the overseas market in which Bharti Airtel aims to raise a similar amount,"" a source told the daily, adding that the deal is expected to value BAIN BV at $8-9 billion. The deal is likely to be completed by December.Back in February, an analyst report from PhillipCapital had noted that ""Bharti's African operations have gained tremendous traction over the last year"", showing ""profit consistency"" over the past several quarters. ""The listing of its African operations will provide Bharti with the options to monetise operations as needed,"" said the report, adding that BAIN BV's IPO ""will provide Bharti with significant ammunition to fight price wars in India"".Due to the prolonged tariff war, the country's largest telco has seen its net profits steadily fall over the past six straight quarters, and its India operations reported its first loss in 15 years in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal. It had managed to stave off a loss at the consolidated level thanks to its Africa operations, which recorded a quarterly profit of Rs 698.7 crore, compared with Rs 26.3 crore a year ago.This listing of BAIN BV would not only help Airtel to unlock value, but would also help bring down its overall debt, which stood at Rs 95,000- crore debt at the end of March this year, up about 4 per cent year-on-year. The IPO route, moreover, will enable the company to raise funds at short notice by diluting stakes in the listed company in future. ""This will be similar to Bharti Infratel, where Airtel had raised billions of dollars through an IPO and subsequent sale of shares while still holding significant stake that is being diluted to raise fresh capital in the holding company, Bharti Airtel,"" explained a source.""Its [Airtel's] ability to monetise its African operations would not only provide the company with a significant war chest, but would also send a signal to its competition about its ability to sustain low tariffs for longer periods,"" noted PhillipCapital, adding, ""With this strategic move from Bharti, we believe that the Indian telecom market is likely to stabilise sooner than expected, and tariff growth should resume in the forthcoming quarters"". That is certainly great news for the stakeholders of the bleeding sector.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-jio-vs-airtel-ambani-mittal-to-raise-funds-from-overseas/story/280425.html
2018-08-30,"The Reliance Industries stock fell for the second consecutive session in trade today on profit-booking at record high levels. Sentiment became bearish around the stock after global brokerage Jefferies retained its underperform rating on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) after the stock's recent record run. Jefferies has given a target price of Rs 880, a downside of nearly 32% from the current levels. At 10:56 am, the Reliance Industries stock was trading 1.12% or 15 points lower at 1,280 level. The stock which opened at 1,300 level hit an intra day low of 1,272 level on the BSE. The Reliance Industries stock hit a 52-week high of 1,328.75 on BSE in yesterday's trade but closed lower at 1,294 level on profit-booking. The stock has been losing for two days and has fallen 3.13% during the same period. It has gained 63.71% during the last one year and has risen 39% since the beginning of this year. Reliance Industries has a beta of 1.28 with the Sensex. Here's a look at why Jefferies cut target price of the stock. The brokerage says, ""Reliance Industries' capital spend trends should also be sobering too with net liability trending higher than most expect.""Jefferies expects Reliance Industries gross refining margins to ease from highs of the 2017-18 financial year as refining demand supply becomes less benign. The gross refining margin (GRM) of the company fell to $10.5 a barrel from $11.9 a barrel in the first quarter of the last financial year.""Lower crude throughout due to planned turnaround of one crude distillation unit and softer refining margins led to decline in segment EBIT. Refining and marketing performance was also impacted by higher flat price and adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials on Y-o-Y basis,"" the company said.Jefferies cast doubts on Reliance Jio and said the expansion of Reliance Industries' telecom business may be bumpier than what the Street is acknowledging. Capital expenditure may halve from FY14-FY16 but could stay elevated, said Jefferies. Telecom capital expenditure will continue and exploration and production spend will pick up, added Jefferies.The return ratios remain modest and net debt higher, the foreign brokerage said. The Reliance Industries stock is valued at 12.5 times FY19 estimated EV/EBITDA-which is 30-35% higher than its past and 30-70% more than its peers, the brokerage said. The firm last week became the first Indian company to cross the Rs 8 lakh crore market capitalisation mark, racing ahead of Tata Sons' crown jewel TCS by more than Rs 20,000 crore in valuation. The market valuation of oil-to-telecom conglomerate crossed the $100-billion mark last month. A few days later, its m-cap surged past Rs 7 lakh crore, making it the second company after IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services to achieve the coveted milestone. TCS had crossed the $100 billion milestone on April 23, 2018.28 of 37 brokerages rate the stock ""buy"" or 'outperform', four ""hold"" and five ""underperform"" or ""sell"", according to analysts' recommendations tracked by Reuters.Reliance Industries reported its highest ever quarterly net profit for the quarter ending June 2018 as bumper earnings from the retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business.Consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore, or Rs 16 per share, in April-June, was 17.9 per cent higher than Rs 8,021 crore, or Rs 13.5 a share, in the same period of previous fiscal, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate said in a statement.

2018-04-19,"After eight years of inaction, the offshore hydrocarbon assets in Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin -- owned by Reliance Industries, BP Plc and Niko -- will see a flush of investments for reviving natural gas production. RIL and BP announced on Thursday that they sanctioned 'satellite cluster' projects to begin investments. The 'satellite cluster' is one of the three projects, others are R Series and MJ1, in the Block KG D6 integrated development. 'R-Series' deep-water gas fields was sanctioned in June 2017.The government oversight panel, headed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), had approved the Rs 40,000 crore investment plan for developing three sets of discoveries in the KG D6 block in February. RIL will invest about Rs 24,000 crore, while its partners BP and Niko Resources will contribute Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 4,000 crore, respectively. The production is expected to start from 2022, a company official said.Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, said in a press statement: ""This development supports the country's imminent need of increasing domestic gas supply and is a firm step towards making India a gas-based economy."" Bob Dudley, BP Group Chief Executive said: ""Reliance and BP are able to develop these discovered gas resources efficiently and economically.""RIL had put together multiple revival plans but failed to recover the gas trapped inside the difficult deep-water terrain in the Bay of Bengal. It roped in British giant BP Plc, which took 30 per cent stake in all of its hydrocarbon assets in a $7-billion deal in 2011, to arrest the production slide. Since formation of RIL-BP partnership in 2011, they have invested Rs 13,000 crore in deep-water exploration and production until now. In addition to the D55 gas discovery announced in 2013, they jointly worked to sustain production from the geologically complex reservoirs in D1, D3 and D26 fields on Block KGD6. However, they failed to increase the production from the old fields, which stands at 5 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) now vis-a-vis its peak of 60 mscmd in 2010. The companies plan to produce 30-35 mscmd of gas from the new fields of KG D6, which consists of the R-Series, Satellites and MJ1. ""For the development of R-Series, the companies have issued the tender and received bids from sub-contractors. We will be able to start work from next year, since the favourable weather for working is available only for four months in a year in the east coast, between January and April. For the development of satellite cluster, we will invite bids from sub-contractors to start the work,"" say the officials. RIL is also looking at the options to optimise the existing offshore infrastructure facilities in KG basin to reduce costs.RIL and its partners had, in 2016, withdrawn some of its arbitrations against the government to be eligible for the gas price revisions. The Modi government was unwilling to heed RIL's demand for arbitration in revising gas price since 2014. The government then revised the price to $5.6 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) from $4.2 for gas producers in India, except for RIL. RIL officials expect that the withdrawal of arbitration will help the company to claim the revised price of gas from the new fields.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/energy/reliance-and-bp-kickstart-the-rs-40000-crore-investment-plan-for-reviving-gas-production-in-kg-basin/story/275273.html

Both these companies have informed the stock exchanges that their respective boards are meeting on October 17 to discuss and approve a proposal for raising funds.""Both Hathway and DEN will issue fresh shares. The fine print of the deal is being worked out,"" said a source, adding, ""It will be a significant stake, but less than 50 per cent."" Given that these two operators boast 7.2 million digital cable subscribers each, with operations across 350 and 200 cities, respectively, buying stakes in them will give a major boost to Jio's plans. Moreover, Hathway  has cornered over 52% of the country's total cable broadband market in India and has the ability to reach 5.5 million homes. DEN has the ability to reach 0.97 million homes.""RIL continues to look at various business plans at any given point of time. But the past two months have been crazy and totally under the radar. The plans are ready on how to use existing infrastructure of MSOs [multiple system operators] to give both video and broadband services,"" said another source.Although some industry experts expect the deals to come under the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) scanner, the sources cited above don't foresee any trouble. ""There is no or very less overlap in the two cable markets. While DEN is strong in Uttar Pradesh and north India, Hathway is strong in central and western India. Also, with five DTH players, none of the operators is in a dominant position in any market, so there is no question of monopoly,"" said one, explaining why CCI permission won't pose a hurdle.Interestingly, RIL's  step-down subsidiary, Reliance Jio Media, which owns a pan-India cable licence, already boast links with both companies JioGigaFiber hopes to leverage. The subsidiary had roped in K. Jayaraman, who had led Hathway, and SN Sharma, then the CEO of DEN Networks, to build its cable business. While Jayaraman continues to be with Reliance Jio, Sharma has since moved back to DEN.The buzz around the stake purchase deals have sent the share prices of Hathway and DEN climbing. The former closed at Rs 28.95 per share, up 6% on the BSE since the beginning of the month, while DEN shares closed at Rs 75.65, up 10.84%.Edited by Sushmita Choudhury Agarwal",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/mukesh-ambani-ril-eyes-controlling-stakes-hathway-den-network-to-push-jiogigafiber-rollout/story/285332.html

Back in 2003, when Reliance Infocomm (now Reliance Communications) had launched the scheme in the same name it was under control of Mukesh Ambani. The scheme in 2003 had led to sharp increase in market share of the company and according to a leading telecom entrepreneur it had raised question on survival of other leading mobile operators in the market . Reliance Infocomm came under control of Anil Ambani after division of assets between the two brothers in 2005. According to the source, Reliance Jio will announce terms and condition of the scheme tomorrow.From August 15 onward, both existing and new JioPhone users will also get to access Facebook, WhatsApp and Youtube.

2018-04-15,"The 270-day deadline for the resolution process set under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has ended for Alok Industries. In fact, it ended on Saturday. But yesterday evening, in a regulatory filing, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said that its joint bid with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd did not meet with the approval of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to Alok Industries.Two senior officials in the know told The Economic Times, only 70 per cent of the lenders endorsed the revised all-cash offer of Rs 5,050 crore, which was not much higher than their previous offer.To remind you, the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had admitted insolvency proceedings against Alok Industries in July 2017. It was among the 12 companies on RBI's first list. The consortium of lenders, led by SBI, is claiming dues of over Rs 23,000 crore from the beleaguered textile company.RIL-JM Financial ARC was the sole bidder and its initial offer of Rs 4,950 crore on April 12 had reportedly been rejected by 30 per cent of the CoC on the grounds that it was too low. Under the IBC, a resolution plan needs approval from at least 75 per cent of the lenders to be eligible for the next stage, which is the NCLT's approval. The daily added that within 24 hours, Reliance-JM Financial ARC then made a revised offer. ""In the second round, again 30% rejected it, implying that those who had rejected it earlier were not happy with the revised offer that increased the bid by just about Rs 100 crore,"" said a source. A major strike against the bid was the fact that it was marginally above the liquidation value, set at Rs 4,200 crore, so even the revised offer may have reportedly spelt a haircut of 83 per cent for the lenders.So what's going to happen to Alok Industries now? According to the bankruptcy law, if cases aren't resolved within 270 days, a company's assets will be liquidated, and as per the report, that's exactly what the resolution professional is likely to now propose. What happens next will also set the benchmark for the fledgling IBC. If the NCLT goes soft and allows a further extension, other pending and future cases will also expect similar leniency, which does not bode well for its whole speedy redressal promise.According to BloombergQuint, Alok Industries is not the only one to have run out of time; the 270-day deadline is also over for Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. and Jyoti Structures Ltd. The CoC for Monnet Ispat has approved a joint resolution plan submitted by JSW Group and AION Capital. In case of Jyoti Structures, lenders approved a plan submitted by a consortium of 50 investors after the deadline ended. Resolution professional for Jyoti Structures, Vandana Garg, has approached the NCLT for the extension to be approved. The report adds that five of the first 12 companies dragged to NCLT are in the last lap of insolvency proceedings, as lenders have approved resolution plans, but the Tribunal has yet to put its seal of approval on them.The recovery statistics under the IBC also leave much to be desired. Earlier this month, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas revealed that less than half of the staggering Rs 9 lakh crore worth of non-performing assets (NPAs)  accumulated by banks have returned due to the new framework set in place in 2016.Meanwhile, the bad loan problem continues to snowball in the sector. In a written answer to the Rajya Sabha in end-March, Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla had admitted that the 21 public sector banks (PSBs) had collectively written-off over Rs 1,154 crore in NPAs in the last fiscal till December 31. As per the PSB data that he submitted, that's a 103 per cent jump from the amount written off in 2016-17 and a scary 519 per cent higher than 2015-16.With agency inputs",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/alok-industries-reliance-jm-financial-ril-bid-lenders-reject/story/274921.html
2018-07-24,"Even after disrupting the telecom sector with cheap data plans, Reliace Jio is in no mood to call it a day. The Mukesh Ambani-led company is reportedly setting up its own production house to create original web series and short films for Jio subscribers. The move could be significant considering the growing popularity of shows produced by over-the-top media services providers like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The recent Netflix-produced Indian series Sacred Games has become all the rage in no time.The oil-to-telecom conglomerate will count on more than 215-million Jio subscribers and eventually expand its user base after the rollout of JioGigaFiber, the optic fiber broadband service by Reliance Jio.""Content market is still not properly tapped... Reliance has hired a bunch of scriptwriters and content creators and is in the process of setting up a huge production house,"" a person aware of the development told Livemint.The rise in video consumption over the past two years has also been due to affordable data tariffs following Reliance Jio's entry in the telecom market. At Reliance Industries' shareholders' meeting, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said that video consumption has grown from 165 crore hours per month to 340 crore hours per month.Reliance Jio currently offers some video content like movies and web series on Jio Cinema. While some of the content is from Reliance-owned Viacom, the company also offers original web series in partnership with studios like ALT Balaji, Eros, etc. According to the report, Jyoti Deshpande, a former group chief executive officer and managing director at Eros, who has joined as head of the media and entertainment business at RIL, is currently driving the company's initiatives to build businesses around the content ecosystem.""Recently, 20-25 creative people have come on board... the company has realised that viewers here are taking to original Indian content on platforms such as Netflix and Amazon in a big way... the company too expects to offer some web series to consumers within 4-6 months,"" the report quoted a source as saying. RIL has also been aggressively expanding in OTT content space. Last year, it acquired a 24.9 per cent stake in Balaji Telefilms. In February this year, it acquired 5 per cent stake in NYSE-listed Eros International for Rs 1,000 crore. The partnership with Eros was to set-up a fund to create and produce content.Jio had earlier joined hands with Hotstar to offer Jio TV service to its users. Viacom18, a joint venture of RIL-owned Network 18, and Viacom has a portfolio entertainment channels such as Colors, MTV, etc.Announced at RIL's 41st AGM, JioGigaFiber will not be your regular broadband connection. Along with the internet, the company plans Ultra HD entertainment on your large screen TV. JioGigaFiber will connect the GigaTV set-top box to your large screen TV, which will allow you to watch every type of content possible.While the commerce-content-carriage play of RIL may be unlikely to pose a challenge to existing players which are well established, the investment in the content space may bode well for budding artists in the country.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-jio-to-produce-web-series-netflix-amazon-prime-video/story/280630.html
2018-08-06,"FMCG firm Britannia Industries has announced it may opt for stock split and issue bonus debentures to shareholders. The stock of the firm currently stands at 6,195 level on BSE. The firm would decide on the stock split at the next board meeting, said Chairman Nusli Wadia during the company's annual general meeting (AGM). Next meeting of the board of directors will be held on August 23, to consider the sub-division of equity shares of the company of face value of Rs 2 each.The firm has also recommended and approved issuance of secured redeemable non-convertible debentures as bonus debentures of Rs 60 in the ratio of 1 bonus debenture for every 1 equity share held by shareholders of the company.The company said it would issue 12,01,59,147 bonus debentures of Rs 720.95 crore.""The company will utilise balance in retained earnings to the extent of Rs 869.11 crore including deemed dividend tax,"" it added.The company would incur a total cost of Rs 1,000 crore to issue bonus debentures and pay dividend to the shareholders.Stock-split is dividing of a share into stocks of lower face value. This leads to a fall in stock price of the company but the total market capitalisation of the stock post-split remains the same. This also means the total value of your shareholding on the day of split remains unchanged even as the number of shares in your account goes up.  This enables many new investors to buy the stock since it has become more affordable for shareholders after a stock split. Announcing its earnings for the quarter ended June 2018, the firm said it reported a 19.41 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 258.08 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, driven by double-digit volume growth.The company had posted a net profit of Rs 216.12 crore in the April-June period a year ago.Its total income stood at Rs 2,585.84 crore in the quarter under review. It was Rs 2,375.01 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, Britannia Industries said in a BSE filing.The company said the reported revenue, part of total income, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, is not comparable to the revenue reported in the previous period due to implementation of GST with effect from July 1, 2017.""Excise duty has subsumed into GST, and hence revenue from sale of goods for the period commencing July 1, 2017 does not include excise duty,"" it added.The large cap stock has expensive valuation with a price to earnings (PE) ratio of 77.31 higher above its peers such as Godrej Consumer (54.4), Dabur India (54.06), Marico (54.25), Colgate Palmolive (42.92) and Glaxosmithkline Consumer (40.67). PE ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. A higher PE ratio indicates that investors expect higher earnings in a stock.  If you invest in stocks with higher PE ratio or expensive stocks, there are chances that it may fall if earnings expectations are not met. Meanwhile, the stock is just 4.31% away from 52-week high of 6,628 level. The stock has clocked 62.19% rise during the last one year and has gained 34.59% since the beginning of this year. Motilal Oswal on July 24, 2018 retained its 'buy' call on Britannia Industries with a target price of 7,300 in one year.  The current market price on that day stood at 6434. Britannia Industries' distribution expansion has resulted in a reach of 5.2m outlets across the country, with direct reach of 1.84m outlets. This should fuel strong growth. The Rs 32,000 crore biscuit market in India is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% in value terms during 2018-2022. Britannia reaches 180 million households in India. 70% of Indian households (80% in urban India and 90% in the metros) consume Britannia's products. The potential for premiumization is huge.Continuing premiumization, significant incremental cost savings, and favorable commodity cost outlook mean further EBITDA margin expansion prospects are bright, as well. We retain Buy with a target price of Rs 7,300 (51 times June 2020E earnings per share; 20% premium to three-year average due to improving visibility on both volume recovery and margin growth), the brokerage said. 23 of 32 brokerages rate the stock ""buy"" or 'outperform', seven ""hold"" and two ""underperform"", according to Reuters.Britannia Industries is a food company, which is engaged in the manufacture of biscuits, cakes and rusks.

2018-07-04,"After disrupting the telecom sector with Reliance Jio, Reliance Jio is betting big on its optic fiber business. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) may announce the commercial launch of wired broadband service JioFiber at its 41st annual general meeting (AGM) tomorrow. RIL is likely to announce the price plans for its JioFiber broadband service, according to reports. JioFiber, the wired broadband offering of Reliance Jio, has already been rolled out in select markets across the country. It currently offers fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband connections with 1.1TB (terabytes) of free data at a speed of 100 mbps. The AGM of oil-to-telecom conglomerate will begin at 11:00 AM at Birla Matushri Sabhagar in Mumbai. For the past two years, the RIL's AGM has become a much-anticipated affair due to big announcements related to Reliance Jio. During last year's AGM, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced the launch of 'free of cost' JioPhone with a refundable Rs 1,500 security deposit.In May, Livemint had reported that Reliance Industries (RIL) is likely to invest Rs 60,000 crore into its telecom unit this fiscal year to beef up its war chest as it plans to launch its broadband services.  In 2016, Mukesh Ambani had said that investment in the telecom startup Jio would be around Rs 2,50,000 crore. According to JioFiber, unlike in a regular broadband connection where the fiber reaches only till the building and the last few meters of end connectivity are connected using traditional cable which reduces the speed, JioFiber connectivity comes directly to your home. Currently, Jio charges a security deposit of Rs 4500 for the ONT device (GigaHub Home Gateway). The deposit will be refunded if you choose to discontinue using the JioFiber services. Reliance Jio is offering its JioFibre service in select cities including Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Chennai among others.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/ril-agm-mukesh-ambani-launch-jiofiber-broadband-reliance-industries/story/279901.html
2018-08-20,"A day after the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer Walmart completed its acquisition of e-tailer Flipkart, the buzz is that Amazon is also busy fanning its offline ambitions. The world's largest online retailer is reportedly interested in Kumar Mangalam Birla's food and grocery supermarket chain More.Citing people in the know, The Economic Times reported that Amazon is teaming up with Goldman Sachs and Samara Capital - a homegrown mid-market India focussed private equity fund - to form a consortium to buy More at an enterprise valuation of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore. Back in end-June, Aditya Birla Retail Ltd (ABRL), the unlisted retail arm of Aditya Birla Group, had signed an ""exclusivity"" agreement with Samara for the sale and the latter, in turn, reached out to Goldman Sachs and Amazon to join forces. The daily added that Goldman Sachs Special Situations Group will be the likely vehicle within the investment bank for this transaction and the consortium is planning to float a separate company or special purpose vehicle in which Amazon will pick up a 49 per cent stake as the ""strategic partner"". A formal announcement is expected either by month-end or in early September.If the deal goes through, More will be Amazon's second direct investment in India's offline retail space, following its 5 per cent stake in Shoppers Stop, India's largest listed department store chain, for Rs 180 crore last September. The Jeff Bezos company also shook the US grocery sector earlier this year with its unexpected $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods, one of the country's most successful retailers.Of course, the same can't be said about the loss-making More. It has tried to raise private equity capital at least twice before but failed. However, as India's fourth-largest supermarket chain with 493 supermarkets and 20 hypermarkets across the country - especially concentrated in the southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana - More is well poised to strengthen Amazon's food and grocery business presence. ABRL competes with the likes of Reliance Retail, Future Group and Avenue Supermart, which runs the D-Mart retail chain.The move also makes sense since the Seattle-based e-commerce giant's ambitions of being the first foreign e-tailer to sell food items directly to customers have been a non-starter due to policy ambiguities. To remind you, last year, Amazon was granted permission by the Indian government to invest $500 million in a wholly-owned venture to sell local produces and packaged food items through online and offline mediums. Though Bezos has reportedly already invested about Rs 100 crore ($14 million) in that business - under Amazon Retail India Pvt - things are yet to gain traction.If Amazon is successful in picking up a stake in More, the development will only intensify the competition in the omni-channel space. Apart from Walmart and Amazon, Chinese behemoth Alibaba, which has invested heavily in India in the retail and payments space through Paytm and BigBasket, is also seeking local retail partners among storied domestic conglomerates such as Tata and Reliance.The latter, in fact, has separately announced plans to create a ""hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform"". At Reliance Industries' 41st AGM meeting last month, Mukesh Ambani had said ""We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services"".

According to The Economic Times, the Mukesh Ambani-led telco is deploying a first-of-its kind satellite backhaul-based network, using capacity from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to take its 4G LTE-based voice and data services to India's hinterlands. To this end, Jio has awarded a contract worth over $10 million to Hughes Communications India Ltd (HCIL), India's largest satellite service operator, offering broadband services under the Hughes brand. The network is under different phases of deployment but Jio has already connected more than 400 LTE sites that were beyond the reach of terrestrial backhaul services. The teleco is reportedly setting up two earth stations in Mumbai and Nagpur, and will set up two mini hubs in Leh and Port Blair for the latest satellite backhaul-based services that will provide connectivity in areas like the North East, Jammu and Kashmir Uttaranchal, Andaman Nicobar, and Lakshadweep. ""The satellite system is key to enabling our vision of providing ubiquitous and seamless connectivity to each and every part of the country,"" Jio group president Jyotindra Thacker told the daily, adding that the company is using Hughes' Jupiter system to support its 4G sites. According to Partho Banerjee, president, HCIL, satellite is the ideal technology for extending 4G/LTE service to remote and rural communities. In India, most telcos, Jio included, largely use microwave to connect towers since laying fibre poses challenges like high deployment costs and right of way (RoW) issues. However, using microwave in the hinterlands, especially hilly areas or islands, creates its own set of problems on account of terrain restrictions as well as the huge investments involved. This is where a satellite-based network can fit in.Of course, Jio is not the first mover in this space. Citing industry watchers, the daily reported that telecom players such as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have been deploying satellite backhaul solutions to some extent, albeit for 2G and 3G services. In fact, BSNL has the most satellite backhauling today for these two networks.""On 4G, though, Jio is the innovator by far on satellite backhauling,"" Shivaji Chatterjee, SVP & Head - Enterprise Business, HCIL told the daily. ""They have taken a bulk capacity of two satellites of ISRO, and have taken our satellite technology which is meant for 4G services. Jio wanted a captive network of its own, and is the first in the industry to do this."" He added that the telco's focus is not just on hilly and island areas, but also on remote areas in the mainland, such as in Maharashtra, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh.While analysts say that satellite can't match microwave or fibre, it nonetheless provides more than enough capacity to offer bandwidth - each site can provide speeds between 10 Mbps and 30 Mbps. Chatterjee added that the satellite platform being used by Jio offers certain kind of compression and acceleration natively for LTE traffic, which provides 50% advantage in terms of bandwidth.Besides, in recent years, the cost of deploying a satellite network has plummeted significantly as the cost of hardware has decreased. Expect it to become increasingly mainstream as the country moves towards 5G.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/reliance-jio-to-use-isro-satellite-to-provide-4g-services-in-rural-remote-areas/story/282261.html
2018-08-12,"In 2016, India's richest man Mukesh Ambani had made a dramatic entry into the telecom sector with Reliance Jio Infocomm and shook up the industry with his disruptive pricing. Now he is reportedly readying for an encore, in the broadband market as well as the cable TV and direct-to-home market this time round.According to The Economic Times, JioGigaFiber will launch with plans priced as low as around Rs 500 a month. That's 50 per cent lower than the current rates charged by cable operators for similar services. To remind you, the high-speed fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service announced by Reliance earlier this year includes a JioGigaTV set top box for 4K enabled media connectivity and streaming services on the idiot box.The report added that home broadband packs promising around 100GB of data per month at 100 Mbps speed are currently offered by cable operators at Rs 700-1,000 a month per household, plus an additional Rs 250-300 per home for TV services. Jio has effectively halved the pricing for a similar bundled offer as it focuses on volumes to drive demand.Better still, Jio Gigafiber's pricing is reportedly expected to be 25-30 per cent cheaper than current 4G mobile data rates, which are in the Rs 2.7-5 per GB range. But this is unlikely to hurt Jio's 4G mobile data business. ""There can be very limited cannibalisation even if Jio prices fixed broadband (with bundled internet TV services) at 30 per cent below 4G mobile broadband rates as the two data products are very different - one meant for the home user and the other for the person on-the move,"" Naveen Kulkarni, telecom analyst at PhillipCapital, told the daily. He also pointed out that the quality of video streaming in a fibre-based home broadband scenario would be far more reliable and consistent than 4G mobile broadband.""Starting this Independence Day, August 15, you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio and Jio.com,"" Ambani had announced at Reliance Industries' 41st AGM meeting last month, adding, ""We will prioritize our JioGigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations"".A source in the know told the daily that the company is sticking to this plan and is looking at a commercial rollout of Jio GigaFiber before Diwali (November 7), initially in the metros and about 80 top tier 1 and 2 markets. The report added that Jio may rely on IP multicast - a bandwidth-conserving technology that reduces traffic by delivering a single stream of information simultaneously to a large group of recipients - to offer internet-based TV services so that home broadband customers don't use up their data for TV. According to Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecom analyst, IP multicasting makes sense because ""without such a technology, Jio would have had to provide each home a data allowance of over 500-600 GB per month for delivering TV services alone, which would limit the company's ability to price home broadband with bundled TV services at an attractive Rs 500 per month"".In many Western countries, consumers are increasingly opting for multiple telecom products in a single ""bundled"" package from a single company in order to save money. For instance, telecoms giants like Verizon in the US and Vodafone Plc in the UK have already moved towards quad-play packages that bundle up fixed line, broadband, mobile and TV, since they not only increase sales - and market share - but also help with customer retention. Jio clearly has similar plans. Edited By Sushmita Choudhury Agarwal",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/jio-gigafiber-plans-will-be-cheaper-than-existing-broadband-rates/story/281260.html
2018-08-01,"After disrupting the telecom sector, Reliance Jio is now looking to create ripples in the broadband market with its JioGigaFiber. Since its announcement at Reliance Industries' 41st annual general meeting, speculations have been rife that the tariffs for JioGigaFiber are likely to be as aggressive as Jio's. Now an expected price list has appeared ahead of JioGigaFiber's rollout.JioGigaFiber is a fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service announced by Reliance Jio earlier this year. The service will extend high speed internet services to homes, offices and shops via an optical fibre network with speeds reaching as high as 1 Gbps. Registrations for the fibre-based broadband service are scheduled to begin from August 15. The broadband service will also include a JioGigaTV set top box for 4K enabled media connectivity and streaming services on a television.Reliance Jio is currently running beta trials for JioGigaFiber in several cities in the run-up to its launch. Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani has claimed that the FTTH broadband network will connect as much as 50 million homes across India. In its first phase, Reliance Jio will introduce JioGigaFiber in 1,100 cities.A report by Trak shows that the plans under JioGigaFiber broadband service will begin for as low as Rs 500. However the Reliance Jio has not confirmed this price list. Below are the expected prices for the JioGigaFiber service:Rs 500 JioGigaFiber PlanThis will be first package under JioGigaFiber which will come with unlimited data up to 300GB per month at 50Mbps. The speed will be reduced past the FUP limit of 300GB.Rs 750 JioGigaFiber PlanThe next plan is expected to be priced at Rs 750 and will offer unlimited data up to 450GB at 50Mbps. This plan is also likely to come with a validity of 30 days.Rs 999 JioGigaFiber PlanThe Rs 999 JioGigaFiber plan will come with unlimited data up to 600GB data at 100Mbps. The validity for the plan is expected to be 30 days.Rs 1,299 JioGigaFiber PlanThis expected plan will offer unlimited data at 100Mbps for 30 days with a FUP limit of 750GB. The speed will be throttled past the FUP limit.Rs 1,599 JioGigaFiber PlanThe highest plan in the bunch will come with 900GB of high speed data at 150Mbps. The validity of plan is likely to be 30 days, where users will see reduction in speed once the FUP limit is exhausted.Where to register for JioGigaFiberReliance Jio will open registrations for the JioGigaFiber broadband services from August 15. Registrations will be accepted via Jio's official website or the My Jio mobile application. While the company plans to launch JioGigaFiber in 1,100 cities in the first phase, the locations with higher number of registrations will be the first to get it.Edited by Vivek Punj",https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/jiogigafiber-plans-surface-ahead-of-launch-prices-registration-details-launch-date/story/280867.html

2018-01-11,"Back in April 2017, Morgan Stanley had predicted that Reliance Jio could become profitable by 2020. About six months later, Reliance Industries announced that its telecoms arm would turn profitable at the net level ""very shortly"", while announcing a pre-tax profit of Rs 260 crore for the business-it's first ever operating profit and the first time earnings were disclosed-for the quarter ended September 2017. The good times have reportedly arrived.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJio) may report its first-ever quarterly profit this month when it announces its December quarter results, sources in the know told Bloomberg today. And Jio owner, Mukesh Ambani, apparently has India's telecom regulator to thank for that.Last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) not only reduced the interconnect usage charges (IUC)-also known as mobile termination rates (MTR)-from 14 paise per minute to 6 paise per minute, but also announced that it would be scrapped entirely from January 1, 2020. At the time rating agency ICRA had claimed that the move would adversely impact the larger incumbents over the medium term, while benefitting the new entrant RJio.TRAI's move was expected to translate into savings for RJio in terms of the IUC it had to pay to other operators-as per RJio's financials, its IUC charges for the second quarter of this fiscal stood at about Rs 2,000 crore, or over a third of its revenue. RJio had previously reported negative adjusted gross revenue of Rs 1,000 crore in the June quarter as its revenues then were lower compared to the IUC it had to shell out. Perhaps that is why Ambani could confidently announce that ""we are ahead of our schedule in terms of the returns that we are generating"" at a December 1 event. On the other hand, the likes of Bharti Airtel suffered-MTR had reportedly contributed as much as 14-15% to its India wireless revenues. ""The 57% cut in MTR, effective October 1, 2017, is likely to impact Bharti Airtel's and Idea Cellular's India wireless EBITDA by around 8% and 11% (on 2QFY18 base), respectively,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent report.It's hard to imagine a telco achieve this crucial milestone within 15-odd months of starting out, but then RJio is known to go against the norm. After all, it had disrupted the industry with its inaugural promise of free voice calls and data on dirt-cheap prices, triggering off a price war that bled out a once sunshine sector and resulted in several players merging forces to survive. Its customer base is currently 160 million strong and growing, and it hiked tariffs in October last year, all of which is good for its bottomline. However, RJio's profitability hinges on several factors like depreciation rate, interest pay-outs due etc. Moreover, as a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst recently said in a note, ""Unfortunately a (unknown) portion of costs are still capitalized as RIL has not yet commissioned its entire telecom infrastructure,"" Jio's earnings numbers are hard to pin down.",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/will-reliance-jio-report-its-first-ever-quarterly-profit-q3-results/story/267884.html
2018-05-25,"Setting records seems to come easy to India's largest software services exporter. A month after Tata Consultancy Services made history as the first listed Indian IT firm to hit market capitalisation of over $100 billion (Rs 6.78 lakh crore), it has now become the first desi company ever to breach the Rs 7 lakh crore mark, albeit briefly. Buoyed by an early rally in its share price - it jumped nearly 2 per cent - the market valuation of TCS jumped to Rs 7,03,309 crore in intra-day session on the BSE, when the stock hit its 52-week high price of Rs 3,674 apiece. Though the share price has since steadily come down to Rs 3,577, the important thing to note is that TCS has gained nearly 35 per cent in the year so far while the Sensex has gone up just 3 per cent.To remind you, on April 23, TCS had similarly entered the coveted $100 billion market cap club within the first hour of trade. Its shares had jumped 4.4 per cent to hit an intra-day high of Rs 3,557 apiece on BSE but it lost the position by end of the trading day. Nonetheless, the feat gave the Tata Group flagship firm entry into the list of the world's 100 most valued organisations, ranking at 97. There are 96 firms with over $100 billion market cap, according to Bloomberg data. Reliance Industries (RIL), led by the country's richest man Mukesh Ambani, was the last Indian firm to make it past the mark way back in 2007.In fact, according to BloombergQuint TCS stock has rallied nearly 14.5 per cent since the company touched $100 billion market value, mainly on the back of a weakening rupee, which has slid 3.2 per cent against the dollar in the last one month.In a nutshell, here is the Mumbai-based company's milestones so far: It started trading in 2004 and its market cap reached $10 billion the following year. It took nearly five years for TCS to become a $25-billion company. In 2013, it crossed the $50 billion mark and is now the country's most valued firm. The other four companies in the Top 5 most valued companies list are Reliance Industries with a market cap of Rs 5.84 lakh crore, HDFC Bank (Rs 5.19 lakh crore), HUL (Rs 3.42 lakh crore) and ITC (Rs 3.31 lakh crore).The big question now is whether TCS can sustain its growth momentum in the near future. It had reported a 4.4 per cent rise in its March quarter net profit at Rs 6,904 crore and a revenue growth of 8.2 per cent at Rs 32,075 crore. ""With robust deal wins and green-shoots in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, there is definite possibility of double-digit revenue growth. With growth acceleration, scale up in digital and support from currency, margins are ready for uptick as well, implying return of double-digit revenue/earnings growth after 3 years,"" Edelweiss Research said in an April note.The company is now looking forward to its 23rd Annual General Meeting, to be held on June 15. Among the items on the agenda is to declare a final dividend of Rs 29 per equity share for the financial year 2017-18 and to appoint a director in place of N.

2018-09-27,"Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Wipro, Tata Steel, NTPC, Indian Oil Corporation & ONGC spent more than their prescribed CSR budgets in FY 2017-18, according to the India CSR Outlook Report. The report was published by NGOBOX which analysed CSR spends of 359 companies. The companies were short-listed on the basis of Rs 1 crore or above prescribed CSR spend in FY 2017-18. BSE-listed or subsidiary of a BSE-listed company were considered. The prescribed CSR Budget of these 359 companies was Rs 9,543.51 crore whereas the actual CSR spend was Rs 8875.93 crore. This accounted for 3/4th of the total CSR spend in IndiaReliance Industries was the top spender that spent more than its prescribed CSR budget. The top ten 10 companies together spent Rs 3,306 crore as part of their CSR fund, while their prescribed CSR spend was Rs 3,160 crore. There is an increase in the prescribed CSR from 6 per cent to 8 per cent  in the actual CSR spend from FY 16-17 and the number of projects have also increased by 25 per cent from the previous year. This indicates a sense of seriousness among companies as they strive to match the prescribed CSR requirements with the actual CSR spends.Some other interesting findings from the report were that CSR fund deposit in PM Relief Fund has gone substantially down by 80 per cent from FY 15-16 to FY 17-18.  The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat together received over 25 per cent of India's total CSR fund. The north-eastern states of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura have received lowest CSR funding so far.Public sector enterprises account for over 1/4th of India's total CSR spend which comes to Rs 2,419 crore. Oil, refinery and petrochemicals sector companies command almost 1/4th of the CSR fund of India, which is Rs 2,092 crore while the lowest is Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals with a CSR compliance of just Rs 294 crore.CSR funding in education and skill development areas have increased by 50 per cent from FY 15-16 to FY 17-18 which comes to Rs 3,121 crore. Over 1/3rd of the CSR spend is on education and skill development projects while over 1/4th of the CSR spend is on WASH and healthcare projects, which is Rs 2,385 crore.

The cost of the proposed project, expected to be commissioned in stages, is estimated to be Rs 2,338 crore, the official added.As per the proposal, no additional land and manpower is required for the proposed project. It has 744 hectare land and 1,794 manpower at present.The company manufactures wide range of products such as Ethylene Oxide, Ethylene Glycol, Linear Low Density High Density Polyethylene (LLHDPE), Hexene-1 and others along with a gas-based CPP.Presently, RIL Nagothane uses a mixture of ethane and propane to produce downstream products and by-products. The proposal is to modify its feedstock ratio in its gas cracker plant owing to availability of imported shale gas ethane. With the proposed change in feedstock mixture resulting in higher production of ethylene, the company wants to expand the capacities of downstream products/by-products to accommodate the increased ethyelene production.That apart, the company has proposed to enhance CPP capacity from 85 mw to 100 mw by way of refurbishing and also use ethane as a fuel owing to its economic viability and availability.

2018-10-29,"The next generation 5G technology is the talk of the town. In the recently-concluded India Mobile Congress 2018, entities across the board - telecom operators, equipment vendors, government bodies - turned their focus entirely on 5G sharing use cases, broad timelines, and details of their trials in various parts of the country. Amongst all operators - now that only four are left - Reliance Jio was possibly the most spirited. For instance, Samsung announced field trials with Jio in New Delhi early next year which was in addition to Jio showcasing use cases - 5G-connected cars and VR-enabled driving - that are jointly developed with Ericsson.In his address at the IMC 2018, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, said that ""by 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country and ready for 5G ahead of others. Every phone in India will be a 4G enabled phone and every customer will have access to 4G connectivity."" Earlier, Jio reportedly said that the operator will launch 5G services within six months of spectrum allocation.Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, also mentioned 5G adoption but pointed out towards the need to keep spectrum prices reasonable and lower down the taxation rates in the sector.The investments in 5G are going to be more obligatory than voluntary for incumbent operators like Airtel and Vodafone Idea Limited given their financial health. While Jio already has a nation-wide 4G network, these players are still in the process of gradually rolling out 4G, and have earmarked huge investments. It seems that by the time these operators will have pan-India 4G network (somewhere around 2020), they will be pushed into 5G without a choice. It means that without making enough returns on their 4G spends; the incumbents will be required to make additional 5G investments.For Jio, the shift to 5G will require lesser incremental cost - perhaps software upgrades in some cases - as compared to incumbents who still have substantial legacy networks that require upgrades to 4G/5G.In August, ratings agency CARE had warned of a lukewarm telco participation if the government pushes for an early 5G spectrum sale. ""It appears like the government is very keen on early adoption of 5G technology. With the financial difficulties faced by the telecom companies, it appears very unlikely that the telcos will opt for spectrum auction which the government plans to roll out in near future,"" the CARE report had said.Telecom regulator TRAI has recommended the base price of Rs 492 crore per megahertz (MHz) for 5G airwaves that are likely to happen in the second half of 2019, as mentioned by telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan last month.According to CARE estimates, if the government sells the 175 MHz of spectrum at the TRAI's recommended price, it will result in payment of Rs 86,100 crore by the telcos, which would be significantly higher than the amount generated by the exchequer - Rs 64,809.1 crore - in the 2016 spectrum auction that had received weak response from the telcos.At the moment, the Indian telco story is more about long-term sustainability of the telcos than next-gen technology. The sector has witnessed major consolidation over the past two years with number of serious players reducing down to three (in addition to state-run BSNL). The challenge for telcos, especially incumbents who have seen vast erosion of net worth, is how to make business sustainable where they are able to generate enough revenues and profits so that they can afford to invest in 5G, be it spectrum, network roll-out or fibre.",https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/5g-knocking-on-the-doors-but-are-telcos-ready/story/286953.html
2018-06-28,"Taking the telecom war to the next frontier - broadband - Reliance Jio is sprucing up its arsenal. That definitely has the industry leader, Bharti Airtel, worried. Reliance Jio is set to launch its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) later this year and from the looks of it the two telecom majors are going to engage in a new price war. Reliance Jio that released its disruptive pricing in 2016 and made a fortune out of it will be looking to replicate the same model for broadband. Does this mean that your broadband prices are going to see a massive drop? Very likely. The Mukesh Ambani-owned 4G carrier is now set to offer a combination of speedy broadband connectivity with data speed of 100 mbps along with a lot of free data, videos and unlimited voice calls through Vo-IP (voice over internet protocol) for Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500 a month. However, industry experts believe that Reliance Jio could be offering this package for free initially as it is starting off in many cities and would want to attract more customers.  According to a report in The Economic Times, Reliance Jio might reveal its launch date for FTTH during Reliance Industries' annual general meeting on July 5.A senior Bharti Airtel executive told the daily that they are keeping an eye on Reliance Jio's developments and will ""do whatever it takes"" to stay in the game. Bharti Airtel is beefing up for this war by setting aside a chunk of its Rs 24,000-crore capex guidance for FY19 for expansion. The company currently has its broadband presence in 89 cities, which they are planning to expand to 100, with a primary target of big data consumption zones. It also has plans to connect 10 million homes by FY21, which should boil down to around 3 to 5 million new home service customers. To counter Reliance Jio's offers, Airtel, too is offering packages at attractive rates. The company also rolled out 15% and 20% discounts on its home broadband packs for customers opting for 6 months and 1 year respectively. Moreover, Airtel will soon commercially roll out its entire spectrum of services under its 'Home Platform'. Airtel's customers will likely be able to connect their Airtel postpaid mobile, Airtel digital TV connections with their broadband and put them together under one bill. According to the report, they may also additionally offer antivirus tools and surveillance solutions.

2018-10-25,"The inaugural session of the India Mobile Congress 2018 on Thursday had the leaders of the telecom world presenting divergent narratives on the sector's health and future. Where Mukesh Ambani, who disrupted the industry with the launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, focussed on the opportunity and potential aspects, the leadership of the older telcos reportedly put the spotlight on high taxes and tariffs.According to Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal, consolidation in the Indian telecom industry hasn't happened in an orderly way and had come at a heavy price with a whopping $50 billion (over Rs 3.66 lakh crore) being wiped off from the sector, The Economic Times reported.  The price wars unleashed by Reliance Jio not only eroded profitability but also forced smaller operators such as Aircel and Reliance Communications Ltd to shut down.Meanwhile, Tata Teleservices and Telenor were acquired by Bharti Airtel Ltd, and Vodafone India and Idea Cellular recently merged to give India's telecom sector a new top cat after around 15 years. The Cellular Operators Association of India's (COAI) annual report for FY18 noted that the telecom operators are in ""severe financial distress"" with a cumulative debt of Rs 7.7-lakh crore and revenue under Rs 2.5 lakh crore.Mittal added that the telecom sector was among ""the most heavily taxed like the tobacco industry"", and called for an early resolution both to this issue as well as to the spate of litigation between telcos and the government. Balesh Sharma who heads the country's largest telco, Vodafone Idea Ltd, reportedly took up a similar refrain and pointed out that the unaffordable tariffs meant that new services could not be launched.On the other hand, Ambani was a lot more upbeat and said that India had witnessed the ""fastest transition"" from 2G/3G services to 4G anywhere in the world. He also pointed out that India has moved from the 155th rank in mobile broadband penetration to being the number one nation in mobile data consumption in the world in less than two years. ""By 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country and ready for 5G ahead of others,"" he added.According to Mail Today, Ambani also spoke about Jio's new fibre-based broadband offering in his address, saying it will offer complete fixed-mobile convergence where Indians will travel seamlessly between mobile and fixed broadband networks 4G and 5G when on the move and Wi-Fi when indoors. He added that the move presents an opportunity to replicate India's success in mobile data consumption for fixed broadband as well. ""I believe India will rise from a lowly 135th rank to be among the top three nations in fixed broadband at a pace that will surprise the world,"" the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman said.He, however, sounded a word of caution on data usage. ""We have to be mindful that data is the most important resource in this new world. And India and Indians will generate a humongous amount of data. It is important that we utilise this rich resource for the benefit of India and Indians, with adequate safeguards,"" said Ambani.Edited by Sushmita Choudhury Agarwal",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/mukesh-ambani-india-will-be-5g-ready-ahead-of-others-rivals-high-taxes-tariffs/story/286594.html
2018-06-28,"The All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) today condemned lenders' decision to accepting Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC's resolution plan for debt-ridden Alok Industries with a deep 83 per cent haircut. The AIBOC said the RIL-JM combine has offered just Rs 5,050 crore for the acquisition of Alok Industries, which owes close to Rs 30,000 crore to a consortium of banks and operational creditors.According to the plan, lenders to Alok Industries will have to take a deep haircut of 83 per cent in approving RIL-JM Financial ARC's resolution plan to take over the bankrupted textile company, it said. Alok Industries is one of the 12 companies, the so-called dirty dozen', identified by the Reserve Bank of India in May last year for initiating bankruptcy proceedings by lenders, the bank officer union said in a statement.RIL-JM Financial has emerged as the sole bidder for the Alok Industries in the first round of auction held in March 2018, but lenders hesitated at accepting the resolution plan which required them to take 85 per cent haircut, it said.  ""RIL-JM later raised its offer price by Rs 100 crore. But lenders again rejected the resolution plan. The resolution plan was finally approved with 72 per cent of lenders voting in its favour,"" it said.The resolution has been facilitated with the assistance of the government by the amendment in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) that requires the approval of only a minimum of 66 per cent of lenders as against 75 per cent earlier, it said. It is quite clear that IBC has been amended with the only objective to allow the RIL-JM taking over Alok Industries and in the process the banks have to endure the haircut of 83 per cent, it added.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/bank-officers-body-protests-rs-25000cr-haircut-on-sale-of-alok-industry-to-reliancejm-combine/story/279678.html
2018-02-27,"The partnership formed last year between Reliance Jio and Samsung entered its next leg at the 2018 Mobile World Congress with something new thrown into the mix - internet of things (IoT). The Mukesh Ambani-led Jio and the Korean tech giant have joined hands to deploy a nationwide cellular IoT network in India. Both companies have also agreed to extend their collaboration to bring LTE coverage to 99 per cent of Indian population and improve network capacity across the country.The commercial NB-IoT (narrowband internet of things) has already been established in Mumbai by Reliance Jio and Samsung in February this year. The aim is to roll out India's first IoT network with new use cases for both the consumer and enterprises such as vehicle tracking, smart appliances, smart metering, security, surveillance and more.""Making sure that everyone benefits from mobile broadband that is both available and affordable to all is our top priority. We will once again partner with Samsung to offer a suite of innovative services for all users,"" said Jyotindra Thacker, President of Reliance Jio Infocomm.NB-IoT is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard which allows a wide range of devices and services to be connected using cellular telecommunications bands.  The NB-IoT network not only utilises the existing spectrum owned by Jio, but can also be enabled by a mere software upgrade to the already installed base stations. The company has also deployed a dedicated cellular IoT virtualised core. On the question of how long before Reliance Jio rolls out IoT in India, Tareq Amin, Senior VP (Technology), Reliance Jio said that the company will have to create an entire ecosystem before the rollout. ""Rather than of doing city-by-city launch, we would launch IoT always pan India. We are not waiting for network readiness, but we are awaiting maturity of the IoT platform,"" he said.Moreover, Jio is hopeful of covering 99 per cent of country's population by Diwali this year. At present the company has a user base of 160 million subscribers in India. We are deploying around 8,000 to 10,000 towers every month, Thacker said.""We are delighted to contribute to Jio's success story and rapid growth. We have been striving to offer the best experience possible to all users at Jio.

2018-08-21,"The aggregate value of promoter holdings in 15 top Tata group companies has crossed $100 billion (Rs 7.03 lakh crore), thanks to the recent surge in TCS and Titan stocks and the depreciation witnessed in the Indian rupee. The market capitalisation of IT bellwether gained slightly on Monday, though it couldn't overtake billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL). TCS value by Monday's closing stood at Rs 7.7 lakh crore, as compared to Rs 7.83 lakh crore of RIL. Titan is the second most valued company (Rs 81,889 crore) in Tata group, followed by Tata Motors (Rs 77,828 crore) and Tata Steel (Rs 67,521 crore).RIL's share price jumped by 2.61 per cent to Rs 1235.15 on Monday and it catapulted the wealth of Ambani family to Rs 3.7 lakh crore ($53 billion). However, the promoter wealth of TCS alone stood at Rs 5.54 lakh crore ($79.21 billion). Ambanis own 47.35 per cent stake in RIL, compared to 71.92 per cent held by promoters of TCS.In April, TCS had breached the $100 billion market capitalisation mark. However, RIL regained the top spot in July last. Last week, TCS went past RIL again, but it was short-lived as RIL bounced back on Monday. However, the fall of Indian rupee, which is at around 70 against the US dollar, has helped the Tata promoters to reach $100 billion valuation from their promoter holding in 15 companies. The Tata Trusts through the holding companies -- Tata Sons and Tata Industries -- control the promoter stake in group companies. Besides, the group companies have many cross-holdings.It was mostly the personal wealth of Tata founders that was transferred to form Tata Trusts -- which include Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Allied Trusts. Tata Trusts controls 66 per cent of the shares of Tata Sons, the principal investment holding company and the promoter of Tata companies. The Pallonji Mistry family also holds 18 per cent stake in Tata Sons.The aggregate market capitalisation of 15 Tata group companies comes to Rs 11.32 lakh crore. The one next to Tatas is HDFC -- which includes HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank, HDFC Asset Management Company and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company -- and its aggregate valuation comes close to Rs 10 lakh crore. In the market valuation game, Bajaj Group companies come fourth after RIL. The market value of RIL started riding high especially after the launch of digital service business, Reliance Jio, in September 2016.",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/promoter-holding-tata-companies-value-100-billion-ambani-family-wealth/story/281505.html

However, the net profit announcement could not prevent the stock from plunging over 6% in trade today. Downgrades The fall came after brokerage CLSA downgraded the stock from 'Buy' to 'Sell' and lowered its target price to Rs 51 from Rs 70. It cut FY19-21 estimates of the firm from 2%-22%.

2018-05-22,"If the buzz is to be believed telecom industry disruptor Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is getting ready to go places, starting with Estonia. According to Mint, Jio will set up a subsidiary in the Baltic nation, which will be handed a loan of Rs 12.20 crore to begin operations by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, an investment holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).""Thanks to its sophisticated e-solutions, over the last decade, Estonia has transformed itself into one of Europe's business success stories. Indian companies would certainly wish to collaborate and imbibe e-governance solutions in this regard and Jio is no exception,"" a second source told the daily.To remind you, India and Estonia have already signed memorandums of understanding in the field of ICT. Then, in March, Republic of Estonia's Entrepreneurship and IT Minister Urve Palo visited India and invited desi entrepreneurs to sign up for e-residency, using which they can conduct a business from Estonia.""E-residency does not give citizenship but e-residency holders can access to e-governance services of Estonia and conduct their business without even visiting Estonia. It gives entrepreneurs access to European market,"" Palo had said at the time. It also works out to the advantage of Estonian firms since they gain business opportunities from e-residents.The programme's press release had added that e-Residency stands for 'Make in India & Sell in Europe'. Launched in 2014, it reportedly has over 30,000 takers from 154 countries already. Significantly, according to a representative of Estonia, by 2025, e-residents are expected to add a total of 1.8 billion euros to the country's economy, be it in terms of state fees and taxes or through job creation, incremental demand, increased administrative efficiencies et al. Incidentally, among the over 1,200 Indians who are e-residents currently is Union Minister for Electronics and IT - as well as Law Minister - Ravi Shankar Prasad. He was given e-residency of Estonia when he visited the country last year.It is this e-residency programme that Mukesh Ambani is hoping to leverage on in taking Jio global. According to an IANS report, Ambani had met up with the Estonian government delegation during their March visit and had expressed interest in collaborating with the country to develop better e-governance solutions for India. He had also stated that the e-residency programme - which offers startups access to a government-issued digital ID, thus enabling the opening of a global EU company fully online - is the gateway to do business in Europe.Given that the European market accounts for 500 million people, it certainly makes an ideal launch-pad for Jio's international aspirations. ""Reliance Jio would want to diversify because, like its competitors, it too is under great pressure in the Indian market. There is every reason to believe that the company may be running operations below cost,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India told the daily. ""In such an environment, it makes sense for any company to diversify in markets where the margins may be better. Besides, the European Union has long worked for a single telecom market. Being in Estonia does give you a foothold to expand further in Europe and helps Jio to mitigate some of the risks in the Indian market.""(With agency inputs)",https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-jio-plans-expand-european-market-estonia-report/story/277431.html
